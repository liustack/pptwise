// Browser half of the pptwise dsh plugin: the deck preview card.
//
// The host half (`./preview-tool.js`) registers `pptwise_preview` and puts
// the rendered bundle on `output.presentationMeta` — a channel persisted with
// the session log and never shown to the model. This file is what turns that
// payload into something a person can look at: a thumbnail strip in the tool
// card, and a full-size modal on click. No new tab, no localhost URL, no
// "open this link yourself", which is the whole reason the tool exists.
//
// `dsh.client.immediately` is not optional for this plugin. The client module
// table is lazy: a boot-graph row only loads when something imports its id,
// and nothing in the shell imports a third-party plugin. Without the flag
// this file is served and never executed — which is exactly how the first
// build shipped, with the tool rendering in the generic row and no error
// anywhere to say the card had never been loaded at all.
//
// Hand-written in the lazy-CJS bundle protocol (`window.__ModuleLoader__.load`
// with a factory returning cordis-plugin exports), matching the host half's
// zero-dependency stance and modlens's precedent: no build step, no JSX, no
// imports from dsh client packages beyond what `require` hands back at
// materialization time. `react` arrives through that same `require`, so this
// package still declares no react dependency of its own.
//
// It renders nothing itself. Every slide it shows is markup `renderSlideSvg`
// already produced, carried verbatim from the tool result — the same single
// rendering path the CLI, the review gallery and the promotional images all
// read from. A second renderer living in a UI is how those would drift into
// describing different products.
//
// The two halves of a card have different lifetimes, and that is the whole of
// what went wrong in the field. What it draws comes from one request; what its
// buttons do is a second request made minutes or days later, against files the
// user may since have deleted. Reopen a transcript after that and the card used
// to have two failure modes and no words for either: under Code Mode the fetch
// 404'd and the entire card — strip, Open, Download — rendered nothing, so the
// tool call read as if it had produced nothing; with a payload already in hand,
// the strip drew perfectly and the viewer opened on
// `{"error":"unknown preview id"}`, displayed as a document, framed by this
// card's own Close button. So: a missing deck is now an answer (the card says
// the deck is gone, and how long it was), every way into the viewer asks the
// route first, and the host half answers the iframe with a page rather than
// with JSON.
//
// The correction after that was learning to tell "gone" from "this request did
// not work" — see `verdictOf`. Collapsing the two meant one flaky response
// permanently retired a deck that was sitting on disk the whole time.
//
// It also *views* nothing of its own any more. The modal used to be a small
// React slideshow — arrow keys, a page counter, prev/next buttons, a stand-in
// for pages the server had declined to send — sitting next to the finished
// `preview.html` that `pptwise preview --html` writes for every run and that
// harnesses without a plugin UI are told to open. Two viewers, one deck, and
// only one of them tested. The modal is now an iframe pointing at that file,
// and keeps only the two things the file cannot do for itself: close, and hand
// over the .pptx.

      // THE STORE.
      //
      // Seven review rounds produced seven defects of one shape: state that
      // could not say which preview it was about, or a write that landed on the
      // wrong one. Three of those were introduced by the fix for the previous
      // one. What is left is one entry and one number, and this note describes
      // only what the code in front of you does.
      //
      // ONE ENTRY. The card draws one deck at a time, so the store holds one
      // deck's state, stamped with the preview id it belongs to. A render reads
      // it only while that stamp matches the deck it is drawing (`mine`);
      // otherwise it reads `UNASKED` and the deck that has scrolled past lends
      // nothing to the one that replaced it — not its verdict, not its open
      // viewer, not its download status. Arriving at a deck replaces the entry
      // outright rather than adjusting the one already there, which is what
      // makes that true of every field at once instead of field by field.
      //
      // ONE NUMBER. A monotonic counter hands out a ticket per request, and one
      // per arrival. An entry starts life holding its arrival's ticket as the
      // high-water mark of both lanes, and a write is accepted only if its
      // ticket is at least the mark of the lane it names. That single
      // comparison does two jobs:
      //
      //  - within one stay, an older answer cannot overwrite a newer one. Two
      //    clicks on Open used to race last-writer-wins: the second request
      //    answered 410 and settled the card, then the first answered 200 and
      //    un-settled it, reopening a viewer for a deck the route had just
      //    disowned. "Last to arrive" and "most recent" are not the same thing,
      //    and only one of them is a fact about the deck.
      //
      //  - across stays, an answer from a stay the card has left is refused by
      //    the same line, because the current entry's mark was taken when the
      //    card arrived — which is after that request went out. This is why
      //    there is no second stamp to compare. An earlier version addressed
      //    entries by `{ id, visit }` and matched the visit exactly, and it had
      //    to: a new entry started both lanes at zero, so a departed stay's
      //    ticket was the higher number and won. Seeding the marks from the
      //    arrival inverts that. The danger did not go away, the arithmetic
      //    turned round — leave the seed at zero and a viewer opens by itself
      //    over a deck the user has only just come back to.
      //
      // Two lanes, deck and download, each with a mark of its own, so a slow
      // export cannot make a fresh verdict look stale, or the reverse.
      //
      // Nothing is written during a render — not the store, and not the counter
      // below. The store is *read* during one, in `deck`, which is ordinary
      // React. What this file must not do is let a render decide or remember

      // was thrown away. Nothing is captured from a render either: a request
      // takes its ticket when it is sent, and what it is measured against is
      // whatever the store holds when it answers.
      //
      // `useLayoutEffect` rather than `useEffect` for the maintenance, and the
      // reason is narrow: it puts the entry in place during the commit that
      // paints the buttons, so there is no frame in which a click could land on
      // a deck that has nowhere to write its answer. It is not load-bearing for
      // ordering — the fetch effect waits for the entry through its dependency
      // list rather than through hook order, so a passive spelling declared
      // anywhere fetches just the same. That was measured, not reasoned: with
      // `maintainStore` rewritten as a passive effect and moved below the fetch
      // effect, all 189 tests across this plugin's two suites stay green. A
      // structural test could tell the two spellings apart. No behaviour test
      // in this suite does.
      //
      // What this does NOT do, stated because overclaiming here has itself been
      // a recurring defect:
      //
      //  - it does not stop a request that has been left behind from finishing.
      //    A download started on a previous visit still saves its file, because
      //    the user did ask for it; what it cannot do is report back.
      //  - it cannot stop a component from keeping state of its own and going
      //    around the store. See the tripwire test for what is and is not
      //    caught, and `.issues/…/design.md` §5.12 for the list of shapes that
      //    are known to slip past it.
      //  - the id stamp is not something a behaviour test in this suite can
      //    see, and that half was measured: drop it from the read and all 189
      //    tests stay green (round 9, K1). `maintainStore` is a layout effect,
      //    so the render that pairs the old entry with the new id is replaced
      //    before the browser paints and before any assertion runs. It is kept
      //    for what that render would do on the way past — mount the viewer's
      //    iframe against the new deck's URL on the strength of the old deck's
      //    open flag, and send the bundle request while the old entry still
      //    holds the marks it would be measured against. That half is read off
      //    React's commit order, not off a failing test, and it is free: the
      //    same comparison is already there for the fetch effect to wait on.
      //
      // `AbortController` was considered and left out: cancelling still leaves
      // an abort rejection to handle, so it moves a check rather than removing
      // one, and adds a second thing to keep in sync.
