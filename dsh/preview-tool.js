// The `pptwise_preview` DSH tool.
//
// Why a tool at all, when this plugin already registers a skill: a skill
// teaches the model to drive the CLI from the terminal, so every call in the
// transcript belongs to `bash` and renders in DSH's generic terminal card.
// pptwise owns no surface there, which is why the review loop has been "open
// http://127.0.0.1:4400 yourself" — the harness had nowhere to put a button.
// A registered tool owns its own `tool.call.toolview` key, and that key is
// the seat the in-conversation preview sits in.
//
// The payload split is the whole design, and the channel it rides took two
// attempts. `output.presentationMeta` looks like the right home — a
// structured, persisted, non-model-facing projection — but the registry
// computes it for TOP-LEVEL calls only, and this repo's own default agent
// preset runs in Code Mode, where every tool is invoked from inside
// `run_code` and is therefore a sub-call. Verified against a real session
// log: 34 top-level `run_code` calls, `pptwise_preview` never once among
// them, and no `presentationMeta` anywhere in the persisted result. The card
// dutifully rendered nothing.
//
// So the deck rides an HTTP route instead (`registerRoute`), which is
// indifferent to call depth:
//
// - the MODEL sees one short line from `output.render`, plus a preview id.
//   A deck's SVG runs to tens of kilobytes and carries nothing the model can
//   act on, so it never enters the transcript.
// - the CARD reads that id out of the result text and fetches from the route:
//   the bundle for its thumbnail strip, and `preview.html` for the viewer it
//   opens in an iframe. Same-origin loopback only.
//
// Nothing here re-renders anything of its own, and — since the viewer became
// an iframe — nothing here reimplements anything either. It shells out to the
// same packaged CLI the skill teaches and serves what `preview --html` already
// wrote: `manifest.json` plus one SVG per page for the strip, and the
// self-contained `preview.html` (filmstrip, keyboard paging, light/dark
// surround, audit findings) for the full-size view. Keeping one rendering path
// is the point, and it now covers the reading path too: a second renderer in a
// UI is how the promotional images and the review conclusions would stop
// describing the same product, and a second *viewer* is how the card and the
// review bundle would stop showing the same deck.
//
// Everything stateful lives inside `createPreviewService`, never at module
// scope. Two services (a plugin reload, a second profile, a test) must not be
// able to see each other's CLI path — a module-level `cliPath` meant the
// second `apply()` silently re-pointed the route the first one had already
// registered.
//
// The decks themselves are the opposite case, and getting that backwards is
// what this file was fixed for. See PREVIEWS ARE HISTORY below.
//
// ONE RENDER WINDOW is the rule everything else here follows. A preview and
// its .pptx are produced by a single `execute` call, from one snapshot, by
// one CLI process generation. Pinning the IR alone was not enough: a second
// CLI run re-reads project and user configuration (theme, style), re-reads
// image files off disk, re-fetches http assets, and may even be a different
// renderer version after a plugin upgrade. None of that is captured by an IR
// file, so the export could differ from the deck the user just approved in
// four separate ways. The download route therefore serves a file, and starts
// no process. The cost is one export per preview, including the previews
// nobody downloads. That is the deliberate price.
//
// What that buys, precisely — the earlier wording here claimed more than the
// code delivers, so here is the honest list:
//
//  - the deck structure and text: pinned, by the snapshot.
//  - local image BYTES: pinned, by inlining them into the snapshot as data
//    URIs (`inlineLocalImages`). Preview and render are still two processes
//    with a real window between them, and an image file edited inside that
//    window used to land in the export but not in the preview. Neither
//    process reads those files any more.
//  - the renderer build: the same `cliPath` for both runs, so only an
//    upgrade mid-`execute` could split them. Not defended against.
//  - project/user configuration: every run reads it fresh from the same cwd,
//    and the window between the preview run and the export run is a whole
//    render, so seconds rather than an instant. Not pinned — an edit landing
//    inside that window would split preview from export. Rare enough to
//    accept, not rare enough to call impossible.
//  - http(s) assets, and local images in formats that need a recode (webp
//    and friends): still fetched or read per run. See `inlineLocalImages`.

// That sentence is the whole storage design, and it is the one the previous

// because both looked reasonable and both guaranteed the same user-visible
// failure: cards that go dead for no reason the user can see.
//
//  1. The records lived in `$TMPDIR/pptwise-previews/<sha256(cliPath)[0:16]>/`.
//     An npm install path carries the version in it
//     (`.pnpm/@liustack+pptwise@0.19.2/…`), so that hash changed on every
//     single plugin upgrade and every historical preview was orphaned the
//     moment the user updated. Measured on a real machine: 14 records, 7 live
//     decks, and every dead one predated the commit that introduced the
//     bucket.
//  2. The rendered decks lived in `$TMPDIR` too, via `mkdtemp`. macOS sweeps
//     that directory on its own schedule, so every card expired after a few
//     days no matter what the records did.
//
// The bucket was there for two stated reasons and neither survives contact:
// "one service must not see another's decks" is a privacy claim about one
// person's own machine, where the only way to reach a deck is to already have
// its UUID out of the transcript it belongs to; and "a record written by a
// different renderer build is not visible" is a version fence guarding
// nothing, because recall serves files that were rendered once and starts no
// renderer. What the fence actually bought was the bug.
//
// So: one fixed root, keyed by nothing. No version, no install path, no
// process id, nothing that an upgrade can move. One directory per call, named
// by the id itself, so a lookup is a path computed from the id rather than a
// path followed out of a file — and published in a single `rename`, so the
// route sees a whole preview or none of one. The three notes below (expiry,
// `PARTIAL_SUFFIX`, `OWNER_MARKER`) are where each of those is argued.

// as the only notice. That is the exact complaint this whole change answers,
// and buying it back at a longer interval is still buying it back.

// Disk therefore grows with the number of calls. The answer to that is
// visibility rather than deletion: every run reports its `outDir` to the model
// and the user, the root is one fixed directory, and removing that directory
// is a safe thing for a person to do.

// One deletion survives, and only one: a render that threw removes the

  // depend on process state instead of on disk. Delete a preview directory and

  // memory, `/html` and `/pptx` went to disk and answered 410, and the moment
  // the entry aged out of the map — or the harness restarted — all three
  // switched to 404. One fact, three answers, and which one you got depended on

  //
  // That is fatal to the whole missing-state design, because the card is built

  // never re-asked. A cached 200 over a deleted deck is a card that draws
  // thumbnails for files that are not there and a download button that fails
  // when clicked.
  //

   * have rendered an empty card and a download that saved a 404 body. The
   * record survives the restart, and the rendered bundle is still sitting in
   * `outDir`, so a reload costs a re-read and nothing else.
   *
   * There used to be a third tier: when `outDir` was gone, re-render the deck
   * from the pinned snapshot. It is deliberately gone, for two reasons.
   * `captureSnapshot` writes the snapshot *into* `outDir`, so "the directory
   * is gone but the snapshot survives" was close to unreachable in the first

   * reads whatever configuration, theme and image bytes exist now, through

   * the download button reporting the deck as gone. One honest answer beats
   * two halves that disagree.
   *
   * FIVE OUTCOMES, EXHAUSTIVE AND MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. They are what the
   * route's status codes are made of, so a real failure landing in the wrong
   * one is a lie told to the user, not a cosmetic slip. In the order this
   * function decides them:
   *
   *  1. the id is not a shape this module hands out -> undefined -> 404
   *     `preview_unknown`. Nothing touches the filesystem.
   *  2. nothing usable at `<root>/<id>` — deleted wholesale, an id from the
   *     old `$TMPDIR` layout that was never in this root, or something at that
   *     name that is not a directory -> undefined -> 404 `preview_unknown`.
   *     All three are the same answer to the card.
   *  3. the directory is there and `record.json` is not -> `PreviewExpired` ->
   *     410 `preview_missing`. This one used to fall into (2), which claimed
   *     the id had never existed while its rendered pages were sitting right
   *     there. A missing bookkeeping file is a preview that lost part of
   *     itself, which is exactly what `missing` means.
   *  4. the record or the manifest is present and cannot be understood ->
   *     `PreviewDamaged` -> 410 `preview_damaged`.
   *  5. anything this process could not read -> `PreviewUnreadable` -> 503
   *     `preview_unreadable`.
   *
   * The split between (2) and (3) is a `stat` of the directory, and it is
   * errno-aware for the same reason everything else here is: a directory this
   * process cannot stat is (5) when a retry could fix the errno and (4) when it
   * could not. Never (2) — which is the half that matters, since (2) is the one
   * answer that retires a deck.
   *
   * Nothing is written on this path, and nothing is remembered from it, so the
   * answer is a function of the disk alone.
