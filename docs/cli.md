# CLI reference

Every command that takes a `<target>` accepts the same three forms: an IR JSON file, a [deck project directory](./ir.md#deck-projects), or a bare deck name.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `render <target> [-o <out.pptx>] [--theme <id>] [--theme-file <file>] [--style <file>] [--draft] [--allow-dropped-content] [--no-git-ignore]` | Validate + render to a `.pptx`. Without `-o`, writes `<project>/.pptwise/<deck>/<deck>.pptx` |
| `validate <target> [--theme <id>] [--theme-file <file>]` | Check the IR, print page-scoped errors and advisory warnings |
| `audit <target> [--json] [--pixels] [--theme <id>] [--theme-file <file>]` | Deterministic deck review, including geometry and monotony, exits 1 when it finds anything (see [Auditing](#auditing)) |
| `asset-brief <target> [--json]` | Image-generation brief for every `image` component (see [Asset briefs](#asset-briefs)) |
| `spec validate <spec.json>` | Check a deck spec against the schema and the strategy-aware hard gates |
| `assemble <dir\|name> [-o <file>]` | Materialize a deck project directory into a single IR JSON file |
| `disassemble <ir.json> -o <dir>` | Split an IR JSON file into a deck project directory |
| `schema [--style \| --spec]` | Print the IR JSON Schema (or the style-override schema, or the deck spec schema) |
| `themes [--json]` | List the 24 built-in themes. `--json` includes id, label, colors, controlled `occasions`, and `identity` |
| `layouts [--json]` | List all registered layouts with id, slide types, pin-only status, summed declared capacity, slots, and arrangements |
| `brand extract <file> -o <out.theme.json> [--id] [--label]` | Extract brand colors and fonts from a `.thmx`/`.potx`/`.pptx` into a partial theme with base `consulting`, entirely locally (see [Themes](./themes.md#extract-your-own-brand)) |
| `narratives [--json]` | List named narrative presets (strategy/pacing/audience axes + theme recommendations) |
| `preview <target> [-o <dir>] [--html] [--theme <id>] [--themes <id,id,...>] [--theme-file <file>] [--no-git-ignore]` | Render each slide to a standalone SVG (`--html` also writes a self-contained `preview.html`). `--themes` (2-4 ids) writes `contact-sheet.html` comparing cover and first content across those themes. Never gated on placeholder pages. Without `-o`, writes `<project>/.pptwise/<deck>/` |
| `serve <target> [--port 4400] [--no-open] [--theme-file <file>]` | Live-preview server: the same review page as `preview --html`, auto-reloading on source changes |
| `migrate <input> -o <output>` | Convert a v3 IR file to v4, rewrite chrome to branding, bloom to classroom, logo_wall to image_grid, or banner-heading to two-column, or convert a `deck.plan.json` project directory to `deck.spec.json`. Deterministic, no model call |
| `init` | Scaffold `pptwise.config.json` (still reads leftover `pptpress.config.json` and `pptfast.config.json`) |
| `config set <key> [value]` / `config show` | Store Pexels/Pixabay/Openverse credentials and generator switches in `$PPTWISE_HOME/config.json`. Omit the value for an apiKey or clientSecret to enter it hidden. `show` masks secrets and labels `(file)` / `(env)` |
| `images search <query> [--orientation] [--color] [--min-width] [--min-height]` | Search Pexels, then Pixabay if keyed, then Openverse (cc0/pdm). Prints attribution lines |
| `images fetch <provider>:<id> --deck <dir> --as <asset_id>` | Download a photo into `.pptwise/<deck>/assets/` with a sidecar |
| `images list --deck <dir>` | List pinned stock photos for a deck |
| `images generate --deck <dir> --as <asset_id> [--prompt]` | Generate with a local CLI (off until enabled) and pin into `.pptwise/<deck>/assets/` |
| `doctor [--json]` | Diagnose this machine's install: skill copies, dsh plugin, runtime, optional capabilities, self-test render, stock-photo keys, and local image generators (see [Doctor](#doctor)) |
| `check-update` / `self-update` | Check npm for a newer release / update the global install |

`--theme-file` works on `render`, `validate`, `audit`, `preview`, and `serve`. It loads and registers a custom theme. It does not select it. Render, validate, audit, and preview can pair it with `--theme <id>`. Serve has no `--theme` flag, so its target spec or IR must already select the custom id.

Theme selection has five levels. They are CLI `--theme`, authored artifact selection (`deck.spec.json` for a project or `theme.id` for a bare IR), project `pptwise.config.json`, user `$PPTWISE_HOME/config.json`, then the schema default `consulting`. Assembling a deck dir fills `theme.id` even when the spec omitted it. That filled default is not an authored artifact layer, so it does not beat project config. `theme.json` in a deck dir and `--theme-file` only register.

`pptwise preview --themes consulting,tech,ink` writes `contact-sheet.html` in the same output directory: one column per theme, rows for the cover and the first content page, SVGs inlined. No extra `--html` flag is required. Use this form for installed built-in ids. Preview an unpersisted custom candidate separately with `preview <target> --theme-file <file> --theme <id> --html`. For a deck project, the sheet repaints layouts already materialized by assembly and does not reassemble each theme's structural faces. A bare IR with omitted layout ids still performs normal selection under each theme override.

Public version 1 theme files share one strict schema with two completeness modes. A partial file has `base` and inherits structural faces. A complete file omits `base` and must declare non-empty cover, chapter, content, and ending face pools. `brand extract` always writes a partial file with `base: "consulting"`. Old unversioned `{ id, style }` files hard-fail with an upgrade message.

After a custom look is confirmed for a deck project, put the file at `theme.json` beside `deck.spec.json` and write its id in the spec. Project commands then need no theme flags. `serve` watches this file. A bare IR can use `--theme-file` for registration, but must also select the id through `--theme` or authored `theme.id`.

`--theme <id>` on render or preview is a repaint. It keeps layout ids already materialized in `deck.json`. To adopt another theme's structural faces, change the spec theme and run `assemble` again.

Omit `-o` and `render`/`preview` write under `.pptwise/<deck>/` at the project root (the directory that holds `pptwise.config.json`, or cwd if there is no project config). The command always prints the absolute path. The first time that directory is created, the CLI appends `.pptwise/` to `.git/info/exclude` so the artifacts stay local. `--no-git-ignore` skips that. A project config `outDir` replaces `.pptwise` wholesale and also skips the exclude line. An explicit `-o` still wins, and that path is never pruned or ignored on the tool's behalf.

`render` refuses to hand you a file that is quietly incomplete. A deck with unfilled placeholder pages needs `--draft`. A deck where a page holds more than its content area can fit — so the layout leaves blocks out, with nothing on the slide to tell a reader — needs `--allow-dropped-content`; the error names the pages and how many blocks each lost. Shortening the page or splitting it in two is the real fix, and `audit` will point at the same pages. Both flags are for the case where you already know and want the file anyway. Neither gate touches `preview` or `serve` — looking at work in progress is what those are for.

## Auditing

`pptwise audit <target> [--json]` renders every page off-screen and runs a deterministic geometry review — no screenshots for a model to squint at, no variance between runs.

Seven checks:

- **overflow** — text past its own box or column.
- **out-of-bounds** — anything past the page edge.
- **low-contrast** — the WCAG luminance ratio between text and its resolved background.
- **overlap** — two components' regions substantially colliding.
- **content-truncated** — text the renderer had to cut to fit. It stamps `data-truncated="1"` and paints no overflow mark.
- **content-dropped** — a card list trimmed to what fits, or a whole component the page had no room for. The renderer stamps silent `data-dropped` (page-level also `data-dropped-silent`). The slide does not show "+N …".
- **monotony**: three or more consecutive audited pages open with the same component type. Placeholder pages and pages with no components break the streak. The finding names the type and the page range, and asks you to mix the lead component (bullets, chart, kpi, blockquote) so neighbouring pages do not read as the same template.

Audit is advisory, not a hard gate. `validate` already rejects a structurally invalid or over-dense deck. Audit catches what a *valid* deck can still get wrong at render time: an author-chosen text color that sits too close to the background, two components whose combined content collides, a card list that had to drop an item.

Add `--pixels` (Node only, needs the optional `sharp` dependency) to also catch text sitting directly on an unscrimmed photo background, by rasterizing the page and sampling real pixels. Every response carries a `checks` field (`{ svg: "completed", pixels: "not-requested" | "completed" }`) so a caller can tell a skipped check from a passed one. The pixel layer's own determinism caveat is in [`contrast-system.md`](./contrast-system.md).

Run it once every page is filled. Human output groups findings by page (`page 3 (p-kpi): [low-contrast] …`, each message carrying a fix suggestion) plus a summary line. `--json` prints the full machine-readable report. The exit code alone is enough for an agent to judge: `0` clean, `1` when it finds anything. Fix the flagged page and re-run `audit` alone, no need to re-render. Skipped placeholder pages are noted in the summary.

```bash
pptwise audit examples/basic.json
# → audited 5 pages, 0 skipped, 0 findings
```

## Asset briefs

`pptwise asset-brief <target> [--json]` writes the brief an image-generation prompt needs and a caller cannot see: the real rendered frame of every `image` component, not the layout's nominal slot.

For each `image` component the brief carries the rendered `frame` (x/y/w/h plus aspect ratio, measured in an off-screen render pass, never a hand-copied constant), the `fit` mode with a crop-safe-zone note, `suggested_pixels` (2× the frame), the resolved theme's `palette` and `mood`, and a paste-ready English `suggested_prompt`.

An `asset_id` with nothing usable in `assets.images` still gets a full entry, marked `missing: true` — that is the generation to-do list. A component the selected layout never draws is reported as `rendered: false` rather than silently dropped.

The brief is purely informational: no exit-code gate, no change to the rendering pipeline, no generation API call.

```bash
pptwise asset-brief my-deck/
# → page 3 (content, p-hero) — pic (missing)
#     frame: 613x307 @ (571,203), aspect 2:1, cover
#     suggested pixels: 1226x614
#     ...
```

## Doctor

`pptwise doctor [--json]` diagnoses the install on this machine. It reads local state only: nothing is written, no network call is made. Rendering a PPTX still needs no credentials. The images section reports whether Pexels/Pixabay/Openverse credentials are present and whether they came from the file or the env. It never prints the value. A following generators section reports whether grok, codex, and antigravity were found on PATH and whether each is enabled.

Eight sections, in the order the report prints them:

- **Installed skill copies.** An installed skill is a *copy* — [`INSTALL.md`](../INSTALL.md) step 2 copies the folder into the harness's skill directory, and that copy keeps its install-time launcher forever. Upgrading the CLI never touches it, so a machine can sit on a months-old version while `pptwise --version` reports something much newer. Doctor scans `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, and `~/.agents/skills` (Pi and OpenCode both read the last one) for a `pptwise/` folder, reads the `PINNED` version out of each copy's `scripts/run.sh`, and names any copy behind the running CLI as stale, with the clone-and-copy line that refreshes it in place ([`INSTALL.md`](../INSTALL.md) step 2's own command, aimed at that copy). Finding no copy at all is normal, not a problem: on dsh the skill ships inside the plugin, and the CLI works on its own. A copy with no `run.sh`, or a `run.sh` with no `PINNED` line, is reported as "version unknown" rather than failing the scan.
- **DSH plugin.** When `~/.dsh/` exists, every profile directory under `~/.dsh/profiles/` is checked for `@liustack/pptwise` — read from the profile's own `node_modules` (what would really load), falling back to the version its `package.json` declares. A profile behind the CLI gets the pinned install command, `npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile <profile> add @liustack/pptwise@<version>`, the version named on purpose because dsh installs through a pnpm that holds back fresh releases and silently resolves `@latest` to an older one. No `~/.dsh/` means the check does not apply, which is not the same as failing it.
- **Runtime.** Node against the `engines` floor (22.19), plus Bun's own version when running under Bun.
- **Optional capabilities.** Whether `sharp` is importable and whether `soffice` is on PATH. Without sharp, preview rasterization and `audit --pixels` are unavailable — plain SVG preview and `.pptx` rendering are unaffected. Without soffice, the PDF export path is unavailable, likewise with no effect on the main flow.
- **Self-test render.** A tiny built-in deck goes through the real pipeline in memory — validate, render a slide to SVG, generate the `.pptx` bytes — with nothing written to disk. The report says how many milliseconds it took. Every other check is an observation about the environment; this one proves the thing actually works.
- **Workspace artifacts.** The project root doctor resolved from cwd, the absolute `.pptwise/` (or configured `outDir`) path, and whether git already ignores it. Informational: it never fails the run and never writes an exclude line.
- **Images.** Optional stock-photo search. Each provider is present or missing, with source `(file)` / `(env)`. Missing keys are informational, never a hard error. On POSIX, a user config file that is group/other-readable is a warning (`chmod 600`). The value is never printed.
- **Image generators.** Optional local CLIs (grok, codex, antigravity). Each is found or not found, enabled or disabled. Missing or disabled generators are informational, never a warning or a hard error. Enable with `pptwise config set images.generators.<id>.enabled true`.

The exit code is `1` only for a hard failure: a Node below the floor, or a self-test render that did not complete. Skill drift, a stale dsh plugin, missing optional capabilities, and missing stock-photo keys are warnings and still exit `0` — the main write-IR → validate → render flow keeps working through all of them. `--json` prints the full structured report (`skills.copies[]`, `dsh.profiles[]`, `capabilities[]`, `selfTest`, `workspace`, `images`, `generators`, and the `errors`/`warnings` arrays the exit code is derived from).

```bash
pptwise doctor
# → Installed skill copies (a copy keeps its install-time version forever)
#     [!] Codex: /Users/me/.codex/skills/pptwise — pins 0.14.0 (stale)
#         fix: rm -rf /tmp/pptwise-src && git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/liustack/pptwise.git /tmp/pptwise-src && cp -R /tmp/pptwise-src/skills/pptwise/. /Users/me/.codex/skills/pptwise/
#   ...
#   Self-test render (a built-in deck through the real pipeline, in memory)
#     [ok] 2 slides validated, rendered, and packed into 20952 bytes in 244ms

```

## The agent loop

The loop an agent should run when it generates a deck:

1. Run `pptwise schema`, `schema --spec`, `narratives --json`, `themes --json`, and `layouts --json` before authoring.
2. Route task occasions and desired identity through the theme metadata. Use narrative recommendations as reference only. When needed, compare two to four candidates with `preview --themes`.
3. Write the spec and page JSON, or a bare IR.
4. Run `pptwise validate` and fix what it reports. Errors carry a page number and an actionable message.
5. Run `pptwise asset-brief` before generating art for any image slot. The real rendered frame and crop mode are not visible in the IR.
6. Run `pptwise audit`. Its exit code alone says whether the deck is clean.
7. Run `pptwise preview` for visual review, then `pptwise render`.

`pptwise preview --html` also writes a self-contained `preview.html` for a human reviewer: keyboard navigation, placeholder badges, zero network calls once it is open in a tab (a remote-URL image asset stays remote, the one gap in self-containment). When every page is filled, that page also overlays the same `audit` findings — per-page badges plus a findings panel, click to jump to the page. A deck with any placeholder page shows a one-line "audit skipped" notice instead.

`preview.html` is read-only: it shows the deck and never writes to it. A reviewer who wants something changed says so in the conversation, usually with a screenshot, and the agent routes it through `pages/*.json`. `pptwise serve <target>` runs the same page live and auto-reloads after source changes. Deck projects watch `theme.json`, and bare IR targets also watch the file supplied through `--theme-file`. Theme edits are reread without restarting the server.

Alongside `preview.html`, `preview --html` also writes `manifest.json`: a flat page list with stable ids, the SVG file each page lives in, the canvas size, and the audit findings per page. That is the half a *program* can read — a harness with its own UI draws the deck from it, one without opens the HTML instead, and neither has to re-render the deck to do it.

The skill wraps this loop for an agent ([`skills/pptwise/SKILL.md`](../skills/pptwise/SKILL.md)), whether it was installed as a skill folder or as the DSH plugin. An internal, model-agnostic benchmark (`tests/bench/`, not published to npm) scores how well a model follows that skill on a fixed question bank — see `tests/bench/README.md`.
