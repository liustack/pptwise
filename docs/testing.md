# Testing

## Layers

1. **Unit + snapshot** (`pnpm test`, vitest) — 391 files / 12461 cases, colocated
   with source as `*.test.ts(x)`. Covers the IR schema, every layout/component,
   the svg2pptx element converters, style tokens, the animation/gradient/
   ea-font/media-dedupe JSZip patches, the deck spec schema and hard gates,
   assemble/disassemble plus the deck-project-directory CLI shell, the v3→v4
   and deck.plan.json→deck.spec.json migration functions, the
   deterministic deck audit (overflow/out-of-bounds/low-contrast/overlap/
   content-truncated/content-dropped), the optional pixel-contrast audit
   (`--pixels` — real-Sharp end-to-end coverage plus a dedicated no-platform
   file for the "nothing can rasterize" contract, see `docs/contrast-system.md`),
   and the PPTX package-audit reader and rules (see "Package-audit hard gate"
   below).
   Snapshots pin rendered SVG/DrawingML output.
   `src/pptx/examples-export.test.ts` renders every `examples/*.json` through
   the full export chain, discovering them from disk rather than listing them —
   the shipped examples are the first thing a new user runs, and before this
   guard existed only `examples/basic.json` was rendered anywhere (e2e), which
   let a broken example ship for two releases.
2. **Node smoke** (`src/platform/node.smoke.test.ts`) — exercises the
   `installNodePlatform()` seam (linkedom DOM parsing, sharp re-encode) against
   real inputs, catching browser/Node DOM behavior drift early.
   `src/platform/node-rasterize.test.ts` does the same for `rasterizeSvg`,
   plus the red-first Sharp/librsvg fidelity probe against a real subset of
   this repo's own SVG output (spec §11.9's escape-clause evidence).
3. **E2E** (`pnpm e2e`) — builds the package, drives the *built* CLI binary
   (`dist/cli.js`, not the vitest-transpiled source) through render/validate/
   preview on `examples/basic.json`, a deck project directory leg (a temp
   spec + pages directory left with one unfilled page → `assemble` reports it
   as a placeholder → a plain `render` is refused → `render --draft` succeeds
   with the placeholder as a real slide → filling the page and re-assembling
   drops the placeholder count to zero → a plain `render` then succeeds too),
   an audit leg (`examples/basic.json` audits clean and exits 0, while a
   deliberately near-background text color, set via a validate-legal
   `theme.style` override, exits 1 with a low-contrast finding in both human
   and `--json` output, plus an `--pixels` leg exercising real Sharp through
   the built binary), a migrate leg (a pre-rename `deck.plan.json`
   project directory migrates to `deck.spec.json` with `scenario`→`narrative`
   and `rhythm`→`beat` renamed and the source file left untouched, both files
   present is a hard error, migrate never overwrites an existing output),
   asserts on the produced pptx's zip structure
   (required XML parts, embedded text), and converts to PDF with LibreOffice
   (`soffice`) when it's installed on the machine — a real render, not a mock.

`pnpm check` runs typecheck + lint + `pnpm test` and is the default merge gate.
`pnpm e2e` is not part of `pnpm check` (it needs a build and is slower) — run
it whenever the render chain (`src/svg/`, `src/pptx/`, `src/themes/`) changes.

## Installed DSH plugin E2E

The DSH browser flow is a host-level smoke test. It proves that the selected
profile loads the published plugin, the model sees the registered skill, and
the plugin's packaged CLI can make a PPTX in a real workspace. Prepare an
isolated existing directory, then run the read-only preflight:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e
pnpm e2e:dsh --workspace /tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e --profile web
```

The preflight checks four boundaries. The selected profile must declare
`@liustack/pptpress`. Its own `node_modules` must contain the same version as
this checkout plus the plugin entry, bundle patch, skill, and packaged CLI.
DSH's composed config must mount the `pptpress` row. The workspace path is
resolved with `fs.realpath`, matching DSH's `WorkspaceRegistry.create`
identity rule, and the canonical value is printed for the browser leg.

On macOS this distinction is observable because `/tmp/...` normally resolves
to `/private/tmp/...`. Add the workspace through DSH's own directory picker
when testing by hand. The picker crosses the host API and preserves the
registry invariant. Chromium automation cannot drive the native directory
picker. If a browser fixture must be seeded outside the UI, store the exact
`canonical workspace` value printed by the preflight. Do not write the
unresolved `/tmp` spelling into the storage fixture. A fresh session records
its canonical cwd, and DSH rejects attachment when that value differs from a
fixture path by strict string comparison.

Start the web profile from the same canonical workspace, then open its URL in
Chromium:

```bash
cd /private/tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Create a fresh session in that workspace and ask DSH to make a small deck with
pptpress, saving its source as `dsh-pptpress-e2e.json` and its output as
`dsh-pptpress-e2e.pptx`. The source must pass the installed CLI's validate and
audit commands. The result must be a non-empty package and render through
LibreOffice when available:

```bash
test -s /private/tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e/dsh-pptpress-e2e.pptx
unzip -tq /private/tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e/dsh-pptpress-e2e.pptx
node ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/@liustack/pptpress/dist/cli.js \
  validate /private/tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e/dsh-pptpress-e2e.json
node ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/@liustack/pptpress/dist/cli.js \
  audit /private/tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e/dsh-pptpress-e2e.json
soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /private/tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e \
  /private/tmp/pptpress-dsh-e2e/dsh-pptpress-e2e.pptx
```

The browser session, generated file, audit output, and rendered PDF together
are the DSH plugin evidence. The normal `pnpm e2e` remains the deterministic
render-chain gate and does not require DSH or model credentials.

## Package-audit hard gate

`generatePptxBlob` (`src/pptx/generate.ts`) runs a package-structure audit
(`src/pptx/package-audit.ts`) on every export, right after the last JSZip
patch (media dedupe) and before returning bytes — piggybacking that patch's
own `JSZip.loadAsync` rather than re-reading the package. It checks OOXML
invariants a broken patch could plausibly violate (core parts present,
`[Content_Types].xml`/relationships parse, `presentation.xml`'s slide list
agrees with its relationships and the actual slide parts, every internal
relationship target resolves, `p:cNvPr` ids are unique per slide, shape
transforms are finite integers with positive `cx`/`cy` except a connector's
one allowed zero axis, animation timing references a real shape on the
same slide, and — IR-aware, via the call's own optional second `ir`
argument (alt-emission-closure fix wave, rewriting the original A11Y-01 alt
chain rule) — a two-sided alt-preservation invariant keyed on the ops that
actually reached svg2pptx, never the IR's *declared* `slide.components`
list (a component `layoutContentFit` gracefully drops on overflow is
correctly not checked at all): (a) every rendered image op that carries
`alt` (from the SVG's `aria-label`) exports that exact string as its
shape's `descr`, and (b) every alt-bearing IR asset that was actually
rendered on the slide has at least one matching rendered `<image>` that
carries its alt as `aria-label` (catches an emission site that draws the
image but forgets to wire the attribute) and
throws a `PptpressError` naming the broken invariant — there is no opt-out. `src/pptx/package-audit.test.ts` renders a real deck and
surgically breaks it via JSZip to prove each invariant actually rejects the
right corruption. `scripts/e2e.mts`'s package-audit leg re-asserts the
three-way slide consistency and id-uniqueness invariants directly against
the built CLI's own output. Read-only by construction —
`PptxPackageReader` (`src/pptx/package-reader.ts`) exposes no mutating
method.

## Visual review gallery

Automated checks answer "does anything overflow, clip, or fall below the
contrast floor". They cannot answer "would you put this in front of a
customer". `pnpm gallery` produces the material for the second question:

```bash
pnpm gallery                    # every table, into .gallery/
pnpm gallery --only=layout      # one table
pnpm gallery --languages=zh,en  # narrow the language axis
```

It renders five tables through the real chain (`validateIr` →
`renderSlideSvg`, the same two calls `render`/`preview` make — no
gallery-specific rendering branch exists, and promotional images are meant
to come from what passes review here). `evals/gallery/hashes.json` pins
929 pages (`gallery-page-v2`):

- **主题表** — all 24 themes running one identical ten-page deck (cover +
  chapter + 7 content + ending), so two themes differ by exactly one
  variable (240 pages)
- **版式表** — every registered layout including pinOnly, ordinary layouts
  on one baseline theme across three language tracks, sparse layouts
  expanded onto the themes that offer them (416 pages)
- **组件表** — every component on one baseline theme, chart variants, and
  dedicated form-variant pages, each in Chinese, English and mixed-script
  content (195 pages)
- **满载表** — eight components filled to capacity without overflowing
  (24 pages)
- **标题构造表** — six heading constructions × three title states (none /
  title / subtitle) × three language tracks, pinned on two-column after a
  chapter slide (54 pages)

Output is `.gallery/`: per-page SVGs, a machine-readable `manifest.json`,
and a self-contained `index.html` that can be double-clicked offline. In
that page each slide takes one of three verdicts (通过 / 限制使用 / 返工)
plus a note; judgements persist in `localStorage` and export as
`verdicts.json`, keyed by page ids derived from identity rather than
position so they survive a re-run.

Surviving a re-run raises the question of whether a judgement still applies,
which is what the page fingerprint answers. It comes in two halves
(`splitPaint`, `evals/gallery/render.ts`): a shape hash over the markup with
every paint value blanked, and a paint hash over exactly those values. A
verdict is stamped with both when it is written, and a later run reads them
back through one rule (`verdictFreshness`, shipped into the page as source so
the reviewer and the tests cannot be running different versions of it):

| shape | paint | the page says | the verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| same | same | nothing | live |
| same | changed | 仅换肤 | live — the slide is not dimmed |
| changed | either | 结论已过期 | re-look before acting on it |

That middle row is the point. A theme redesign rewrites every color in the
corpus and moves no layout: under the old single whole-markup hash it
invalidated every verdict at once, and the 2026-08-19 round handed back seven
of thirty marked stale that a human then re-made by hand, all of them about
geometry that had not moved. Verdicts written before the split carry one hash
and no way to tell the two apart, so they keep the old all-or-nothing rule
until they are re-stamped — `manifest.json` is at `manifestVersion: 2` and the
exported payload at `pptpress-gallery-verdicts/3`, both additive.

The corpus (`evals/gallery/corpus/`) is deliberately **not**
`src/svg/audit/stress-fixtures.ts` — those decks are pathological on
purpose. This one is ordinary, plausible content at the length a real
author writes, because the ordinary case is what a human can judge and a
test cannot.

`scripts/gallery.test.mts` runs the whole matrix on every `pnpm check`, so a
renderer change that breaks a corpus page fails there rather than turning up
as a hole partway through a review sitting. It also fails if a component
type gains no corpus builder — silently dropping a component off the table
would let the review sign off on something nobody looked at.

### Real-geometry pass (`--bbox`)

Every other automated check measures text with `measureTextUnits`, the same
estimator the layout code uses to decide what fits. When that estimate is
wrong, the layout and the audit are wrong together and agree with each other.
`--bbox` breaks the tie by mounting each rendered page in a real browser and
asking it for `getBBox()`:

```bash
pnpm gallery --bbox                 # + a real-browser geometry pass
pnpm gallery --bbox --bbox-floor=4  # loosen the fixed part of the slack
```

It needs Playwright, which this repo deliberately does **not** depend on —
`pnpm check` runs the same matrix on every commit and must never pull a
browser. Install it into the checkout (`pnpm add -D playwright && pnpm exec
playwright install chromium`) or point `PPTPRESS_PLAYWRIGHT` at an existing
install; a machine that already has Chromium installed needs no download at all. Results are
written to `.gallery/bbox.json` and depend on the fonts installed on the
machine, the same caveat the PowerPoint output carries.

Each measured overflow lands in one of three buckets
(`evals/gallery/bbox.ts`):

- **measurement slack** — `getBBox()` reports the *ink* box while the declared
  boxes are laid out against advance widths, and the disagreement accumulates
  along a line. So the horizontal allowance is proportional (1% of the box,
  2px floor, 8px cap) rather than flat: on an earlier 461-page corpus one cause — a
  full-width Chinese serif line — measures 3px past a 435px column and 6px
  past a 1088px one, and a flat threshold would call the first clean and the
  second a defect. Nothing accumulates down a baseline, so vertical overflow
  is judged against the flat floor alone.
- **designed bleed** — `evals/gallery/bbox-exemptions.ts`, keyed on layout
  *plus* the text allowed to bleed, so a real defect landing on the same page
  still gets reported. Kept there rather than as a `data-bleed` attribute
  because marking it in the renderer would move bytes that committed goldens
  and preview files pin.
- **defect** — everything else. Reported, and the run exits non-zero.

Background and the reasoning behind how the matrix is cut:
`.issues/2026-08-15-release-readiness/spec.md`.

### Automated visual audit (`pnpm evals:gallery`)

`pnpm evals:gallery` is the agent audit over the same matrix. L1 is a
zero-model geometry pass (overflow, out-of-bounds, overlap, strikethrough,
edge-stick, font-size, overflow markers, Latin vertical type). L2 is grok
vision against `evals/gallery/rubric/`.
Default mode is incremental: re-render, diff `evals/gallery/hashes.json`
(`gallery-page-v2`), and audit `changed ∪ added`. `--full` audits every
page. `--l1-only` skips L2. L2 is also skipped when `CI=true` or grok is
not on PATH. The skip reason is printed. Verdicts land in
`evals/gallery/verdicts/` and that directory is gitignored. Live corpus
findings are written to the report and do not fail the process.

## Snapshot policy

**Never blind-update with `-u`.** A snapshot diff *is* a behavior change —
before regenerating, read the diff and confirm it's the change you intended.
Silently accepting a snapshot update is how visual regressions slip past
review.

The two unassigned-theme byte nails
(`src/svg/__fixtures__/emphasis-unassigned-bytes.json` and
`src/svg/heading-treatments/__fixtures__/unassigned-bytes.json`) recapture
with `pnpm fixtures:unassigned-bytes` after an intended renderer change,
never by editing hashes by hand.

## PowerPoint repair-dialog gate

Native PowerPoint is stricter than LibreOffice and pptxgenjs about DrawingML
well-formedness. A file that opens fine in `soffice` can still trigger
PowerPoint's "we found a problem with some content" repair dialog. Before
publishing a release that touched the export XML (`src/pptx/`, especially
`svg2pptx/` or the animation/gradient/ea-font JSZip patches), run a local repair-dialog
probe on a real macOS + PowerPoint install:

```bash
pnpm e2e   # produce .e2e-out/*.pptx first
osascript scripts/ppt-repair-check.applescript "$PWD/.e2e-out/basic.pptx"   # → OK
osascript scripts/ppt-repair-check.applescript "$PWD/.e2e-out/webp.pptx"    # → OK
```

The script quits PowerPoint, opens the file, and polls for the repair dialog
(`REPAIR_DIALOG`), a repaired-title window (`REPAIRED_TITLE`), a clean open
(`OK`), or `TIMEOUT` (~30s per file). A clean open across the example decks
is the release gate — no automated substitute reliably catches this class of
bug, since neither LibreOffice nor pptxgenjs's own validation reproduces
PowerPoint's parser.
