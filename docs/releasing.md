# Releasing

Versioning uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) in local
mode — no CI is involved today (the CI rebuild is a recorded future item, and
publishing uses an interactive npm passkey that automation cannot hold). The
version's single source of truth is `package.json`. `src/version.ts` mirrors
it, pinned by `src/version-sync.test.ts`, so a missed sync fails `pnpm check`.

## During development

Any wave that ships user-visible change should leave a changeset behind:

```bash
npx changeset        # pick the bump level, write a human-readable summary
```

This creates a markdown file under `.changeset/` that travels with the branch.
Multiple changesets accumulate — `changeset version` later collapses them into
one correct bump (two minors do not become two bumps).

## Cutting a release

On a release branch off `main`:

```bash
pnpm release:version   # changeset version + sync src/version.ts + stamp the docs
pnpm check             # guard tests confirm every copy of the version agrees
```

`release:version` also runs `scripts/stamp.mts`, which rewrites two kinds of
pinned version to the new one:

- **The skill launchers.** `PINNED` in `skills/pptpress/scripts/run.sh` and
  `$Pinned` in `run.ps1`. This is the one that matters most: on a machine with
  no `pptpress` on `PATH`, that constant decides which release actually runs
  when a harness invokes the skill.
- **Every pinned install command in the repo's markdown** (the dsh
  `plugin add` lines in the READMEs and `INSTALL.md`, the no-script fallback
  commands in both SKILL files).

The drift test (`scripts/stamp.test.mts`, part of `pnpm check`) reads each one
back, so a forgotten stamp fails the release before it ships stale numbers.

Review `CHANGELOG.md`, commit, merge to `main`, then tag the merge:

```bash
git tag v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

## Publishing (maintainer, manual)

1. `pnpm e2e` — full chain on the built CLI.
2. PowerPoint repair-dialog probe (`docs/testing.md`) — mandatory whenever the
   export XML changed since the last release.
3. `npm publish` — `prepublishOnly` reruns `pnpm check && pnpm e2e` as the
   final gate. On a machine running concurrent heavy sessions the vitest leg
   can hit spurious 30s timeouts — bound the workers for the publish run
   (`VITEST_MAX_THREADS=2 VITEST_MAX_FORKS=2 npm publish`) rather than
   skipping the gate, and isolate-rerun any failing file first to confirm
   it is contention, not a regression.

When CI is rebuilt, migrate publishing to npm trusted publishing (OIDC) and
let the changesets action open version PRs — that is the current ecosystem
best practice this local flow deliberately scales down from.
