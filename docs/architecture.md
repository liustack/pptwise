# Architecture

A PPT deck is, at bottom, five orthogonal concerns: a **content model**, a **2D
layout**, a **visual style**, **time-based interaction** (transitions/animation),
and a **narrative** that sequences slides. pptwise gives each one exactly one
owning layer, so a change in one dimension (say, a new style) never leaks into
another (layout code stays style-agnostic).

| Dimension | Owning layer | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Content model | IR (zod schema, semantic components) | `src/ir/` |
| 2D layout | layout registry (standard layouts + image takeovers) + components + capacity tables + seeded variety | `src/svg/` |
| Visual style | style tokens + theme definitions (curated layout sets + motif + optional per-page-type layout tendencies, 24 built-in themes) | `src/themes/` |
| Time-based interaction | `meta.animation` in the IR → slide transition / element entrance patches | `src/pptx/` |
| Narrative | narrative axes (strategy × pacing × audience, named presets) resolving editorial discipline, plus a first-class spec artifact (`deck.spec.json` — locked page order/type/heading, strategy-aware hard gates via `spec validate`) that `assembleDeck`/`disassembleDeck` materialize to and from IR, driving a six-phase spec→fill skill methodology for slide sequencing | `src/spec/`, `src/narrative/`, `skills/` |

The core insight, carried over from the production system pptwise was extracted
from: **visual variety comes from tokens × layout library × seed — not
freeform drawing.** Swapping only color tokens (the shadcn-style reskin) still
converges on sameness. The layout library is what raises the ceiling — and,
as of the theme-structure wave, the theme axis is no longer a constant term in
that product: a theme's optional `layoutTendencies` (`docs/concepts.md`'s theme
section) softly steers *which* layout the seeded pick favors, per page type,
so swapping only the theme (same IR, same seed) can now itself change the
realized layout sequence, not just the palette — see `docs/selection-and-seed.md`
for the mechanics.

## Render chain

Every slide renders through exactly one path, so preview and export can never
drift apart:

```
IR (validated) → FullSlideSvg (React → one flat 1280×720 SVG)
  → svg2pptx (per-element DrawingML ops)
  → pptxgenjs + JSZip patches (animations, gradients, ea font slots, media dedupe)
  → .pptx bytes
```

`renderSlideSvg` and `generatePptx` both start from the same `FullSlideSvg`
component — the SDK has no second, cheaper rendering path to fall out of sync.

### Fidelity ledger

`svg2pptx`'s dispatch (`svg2pptx/dispatch.ts`'s `leafToOp` → `svg2pptx/render.ts`'s
`renderOp`) is a closed table — every SVG leaf tag it recognizes lands on
exactly one native DrawingML shape, and any tag it doesn't recognize is
simply skipped (not drawn), never rasterized as a fallback:

| SVG leaf | Op kind | pptxgenjs call | PPTX result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<rect>` | `shape` | `addShape("rect"\|"roundRect")` | native shape (editable) |
| `<circle>`/`<ellipse>` | `shape` | `addShape("ellipse")` | native shape (editable) |
| `<line>` | `line` | `addShape("line")` | native connector (editable) |
| `<polygon>`/`<polyline>`/`<path>` | `path` | `addShape("custGeom")` | native custom geometry (editable) |
| `<text>` | `text` | `addText` | native text box/run (editable) |
| `<image>` | `image` | `addImage` | `<p:pic>` — the only picture path |

Icons (`src/svg/icons.tsx`'s lucide path/circle/ellipse/rect/line/polyline/polygon
primitives) flow through this same table like any other vector markup and
land as custGeom or native shapes — never a picture.

**Invariant: the only rasterization exit in the export chain is `<image>`
backed by a real, resolved asset.** Every `<image>`-emitting call site — the
`image`/`image_grid`/`image_compare` components, `Background`'s asset
background, `Branding`'s logo, and the 4 `image-*` takeover layouts
(`image-pages.tsx`) — resolves a real asset first. When one is missing it
degrades to a placeholder (a `<rect>` for a content image slot, or the logo
simply omitting itself) and never degrades to an `<image>`. Separately,
`rasterizeSvg` (next section) — the one function in this codebase that turns
SVG into pixels — is reachable only from the optional `--pixels` audit path
(`src/svg/audit/pixel-audit.ts`) — `generatePptxBlob`/`svg2pptx` never call
it. Rasterization and export are two disjoint subsystems by construction.
Regression-guarded by `src/pptx/generate-fidelity-export.test.ts`: a deck
covering every registered component type with zero real assets exports with
`ppt/media/` empty and zero `<p:pic>` anywhere. Adding one real image asset
moves the count by exactly +1, landing on exactly that slide.

## Platform seam

`src/index.ts` and everything it imports must stay usable in a browser: no
`commander`, no `linkedom`, no `sharp`. Three seams in `src/platform/registry.ts`
(`domParser`, `recodeImageToPng`, `rasterizeSvg`) are `undefined` until
something calls `installPlatform()`. `src/platform/node.ts` supplies the Node
implementation (linkedom for DOM parsing, sharp for image re-encoding and SVG
rasterization) via `installNodePlatform()` — the CLI calls it on startup. SDK
consumers running in Node must call it themselves before rendering.
`rasterizeSvg` (audit-v2 phase B, `docs/contrast-system.md`'s own pixel-layer
section) is the one seam with a real browser default too:
`src/platform/browser.ts`'s `rasterizeSvgInBrowser` (native `Image` +
`OffscreenCanvas`/`<canvas>`) is applied as a plain `?? fallback` at its one
call site (`src/svg/audit/pixel-audit.ts`), the same pattern `domParser`'s
own `?? globalThis.DOMParser` fallback already uses — not through
`installPlatform()`, since nothing calls that automatically in a browser.

### Distribution: the seam being real vs. the package being loadable

"`src/index.ts`'s closure is browser-safe" and "the published package loads
in a browser" are two different claims — the P2 browser-distribution wave
closed the gap between them. The seam above has always been true (verified
against a real Chromium tab, not just jsdom), but the default build
(`tsup.config.ts`'s `index`/`node`/`cli` entries) externalizes every
`dependencies` entry (`react`, `react-dom`, `zod`, `jszip`,
`pptxgenjs`) as bare ESM specifiers — correct for a bundler consumer
(Vite/webpack resolve them from `node_modules`, deduped against the rest of
the app), fatal for a bare `<script type="module">` (`Failed to resolve
module specifier "zod"` before a single line of the module runs — no
partial availability, a top-level `import` failure takes the whole module
down). `package.json`'s `exports` map now offers two additional, fully
self-contained subpaths built from the same `src/index.ts` closure, wired
through two more `tsup.config.ts` array entries (`platform: "browser"`,
`noExternal: [/.*/]`, `splitting: false`, so each is one file with zero
relative-chunk fetches and zero bare specifiers left to resolve):

- **`./browser`** (`dist/browser.js`) — the full engine, every dependency
  inlined (react + react-dom/server + zod + jszip + pptxgenjs, ~1.7 MB
  raw / ~455 KB gzip). `platform: "browser"` makes esbuild honor each
  dependency's own package.json `browser` field (pptxgenjs and jszip both
  ship one, remapping their Node-only `fs`/`https` code paths away) instead
  of resolving their Node/CJS main — real-Chromium-verified against
  `dist/index.js`'s underlying render/export/audit chain in an earlier
  investigation (`generatePptx`, `auditDeck`, `auditDeck({ pixels: true })`
  all functionally correct, byte-identical output to the Node CLI).
- **`./validate`** (`dist/validate.js`) — `validateIr` and nothing else
  reachable from the render/export chain, for an "embed a validator" page
  that has no reason to carry `react`/`pptxgenjs`/`jszip` at all
  (~730 KB raw / ~155 KB gzip, a fraction of `/browser`'s size). Its source,
  `src/validate.ts`, imports from `src/validate-core.ts` — a module carved
  out of what used to be all of `src/api.ts` — directly, not through
  `src/api.ts` itself (which also defines `renderSlideSvg`/`generatePptx`
  and statically imports `src/svg/render-slide.ts`/`src/pptx/generate.ts`).
  A first attempt re-exported the light subset through `src/api.ts` and
  relied on the bundler to tree-shake the unused `generatePptx`/
  `renderSlideSvg` bindings away — it didn't: esbuild's CJS-interop wrapper
  for jszip/react-dom's `require()`-based code kept their init closures in
  the output even though the two functions' own bodies were correctly
  eliminated. Importing `src/validate-core.ts` directly makes the exclusion
  a physical file-graph fact instead of a tree-shaking bet — `src/validate.ts`'s
  build never sees `src/api.ts`, `src/pptx/generate.ts`, or
  `src/svg/render-slide.ts` as input files at all, whether or not a future
  esbuild version's tree-shaking gets more aggressive about CJS interop.

The default `"."`/`"./node"` entries are unchanged — `dependencies` stay
external there, same as before this wave. `scripts/e2e.mts` (which already
runs after `pnpm build`) parses both new bundles post-build and asserts zero
surviving bare top-level import/export specifiers, generous size-budget
smoke bounds, and tree separation (`dist/validate.js` must not contain
`PptxGenJS`/`renderToStaticMarkup`/`JSZip`/`graphlib` — real bundled-code
markers, not the npm package-name substring, since minification drops the
latter but keeps distinctive API surface intact) — the regression guard for
the exact failure class a bare `<script type="module">` hits. See the
README's own Browser section for the consumer-facing quickstart and honest
caveats (assets must be `data:` URIs or CORS-readable `http(s)` URLs,
`--pixels`-equivalent auditing needs `OffscreenCanvas`).

## Domain files

Layouts and components are organized by domain — each one's own definition
lives beside (or across a matched pair of) files named for it — not
collected into one big literal table. Two registries/aggregators consume
these domain files by importing and combining them, never by holding the
content themselves:

- **A layout definition lives with its implementation.** Each of the 130
  single-layout files exports `layoutDef: LayoutDefinition` at the
  bottom of its own `src/svg/layouts/<name>.tsx` file, beside the JSX
  that draws it. `src/svg/image-pages.tsx`, one level above `layouts/`, exports 4 uniquely named ones instead,
  since one file implements all 4 image takeovers and they can't share the
  bare `layoutDef` name the 130 single-layout files use. `src/svg/layouts/registry.ts`
  imports every one and assembles `LAYOUT_REGISTRY` from them. "Take one
  layout away whole" is a single-file operation, not a two-file
  archaeology dig.
- **A component is two same-named domain files, one per side of the
  IR/SVG boundary.** `src/ir/components/<name>.ts` exports `schema` (the
  zod shape), `aliases` (a `ComponentAliasSpec` — `{}` if the component
  declares no synonym-rescue rows) and `traits` (the render-trait
  declaration `component-traits.ts` aggregates). `src/svg/components/<name>.tsx`
  exports `renderDef` (`{ measure, render }`). Nothing about a component's
  shape, field aliasing, traits, or rendering lives anywhere but this pair.
- **Aggregator discipline.** Every table that spans domain files —
  `src/ir/index.ts`'s `ComponentSchema` discriminated union,
  `src/svg/layouts/registry.ts`'s `LAYOUT_REGISTRY`,
  `src/svg/components/index.tsx`'s `RENDER_DEFS`,
  `src/svg/component-traits.ts`'s `ALL_TRAITS`, `src/ir/field-aliases.ts`'s
  two alias tables — does only computed construction over the imported
  domain values (unions, `Record`/`Set` building, lists derived from
  another structure, e.g. `COMPONENT_TYPES` from `ComponentSchema.options`)
  and never holds a hand-copied literal that could drift from what the
  domain file actually declares. `component-traits.ts`'s `EVIDENCE_TYPES`
  is the one deliberate exception: relative priority order across
  component types ("chart beats image beats comparison") is knowledge no
  single domain file can declare about itself, so the order stays
  hand-written there — each listed component's own domain file still
  declares the membership half (`traits.evidence: true`), and a test
  (`component-traits.test.ts`) asserts the two stay in sync.

**Adding a component** touches, at minimum, the 2 domain files above plus
6 points a normal `pnpm check` catches if skipped — a missing entry fails
the build or the test suite, never silently (this list was measured
against the most recent real addition, `data_table`, not predicted):

1. `src/ir/index.ts` — import the new schema, add it to `ComponentSchema`'s
   `z.discriminatedUnion` array
2. `src/svg/components/index.tsx` — import the new `renderDef`, add it to
   `RENDER_DEFS` (a total `Record<ComponentType, RenderDef>` — TypeScript
   rejects the object literal at compile time if any `ComponentType` is
   missing)
3. `src/svg/component-traits.ts` — import the new `traits`, add it to
   `ALL_TRAITS` (same total-`Record` compile guard)
4. `src/ir/corpus-coverage.test.ts` — the new type must be behaviorally
   exercised by the validation corpus at least once, either because an
   existing `examples/*.json`/`STRESS_DECKS` fixture already uses it, or
   because a new `COVERAGE_ENTRIES` `-valid`/`-tripwire` pair was added
   for it (the test fails red otherwise)
5. `src/pptx/generate-fidelity-export.test.ts` — `COMPONENT_BY_TYPE` is
   another total `Record<Component["type"], Component>`: the fidelity
   sweep needs one real instance of the new type (compile error if
   missing)
6. `src/svg/audit/full-matrix-contrast.test.ts` — `MUTED_SURFACE_CLASS`
   classifies every component type for the contrast sweep; an
   `Object.hasOwn` exhaustiveness test fails red until the new type is
   classified

Plus, only when they apply: a `src/ir/field-aliases.ts` row in either
alias table (only if the component needs a synonym rescue); an
`EVIDENCE_TYPES` insertion when `traits.evidence: true` (the position is
an editorial call, not mechanical); a `skills/pptwise/SKILL.md`
"Component selection" table row, so the authoring skill's own guidance
knows the type exists; any doc's component-count mention that reads as a
literal number rather than worded ("every component type"); and a
`STRESS_DECKS` fixture entry if the type needs render-pressure coverage
beyond what the validation corpus already exercises.

## Adding a theme

A new theme is style tokens + an optional brand config, never new render
code: add a `StyleTokens` object under `src/themes/`, then register its id
and tokens in `CANONICAL_THEME_IDS` / `THEME_STYLES` (`src/themes/index.ts`)
and its id in `BUILTIN_THEME_IDS` (`src/ir/index.ts`). `THEME_DEFINITIONS`
(`src/themes/definitions.ts`) derives the theme entry from those
automatically — add a `BRANDS` entry there only if the theme needs
non-default brand frame. A new theme also needs a `layouts` entry in
`LAYOUTS` (`src/themes/definitions.ts`) — that record stays total over
`CanonicalThemeId`, so a missing entry fails to compile. Each of the four
page types defaults to `FULL_LAYOUTS.<type>` (every registered auto-selectable
layout for that type). The post-v0.3 W8 fix round reverted the last three
chapter-only curation exclusions (classroom/heritage excluding
`fashion-chapter`, an artifact of `readableOn`'s old fixed-luminance
threshold) once `src/svg/ink.ts`'s real dual-ink contrast comparison
confirmed all three clear 3:1 without the exclusion
(`src/themes/definitions.ts` has the full history). Covers, chapters, and
endings now lock to their Claude Design board faces. Content auto-pool is 9
ids (`banner-heading` retired).
Narrowing a page type below the full set is still supported and stays a
deliberate curation act, not a requirement — see `docs/contrast-system.md`
for why a narrowing usually turns out to be a contrast bug in disguise rather
than a real design constraint. The SDK registration seam (`registerTheme`,
same file) mirrors the full-set default: its `layouts` argument, and each of
its four page-type entries, are independently optional and fall back to the
same full set when omitted. Layouts and components read only from tokens,
so no layout file changes. A theme may also optionally declare
`layoutTendencies` (theme-structure wave) — a per-page-type soft weight over
ids already in that same page type's `layouts` entry, giving the new theme a
structural personality rather than only a palette; see `docs/concepts.md`'s
theme section and `docs/selection-and-seed.md` for the mechanics. Leaving it
undeclared (the default) is still a legitimate choice for a custom theme, not
a lesser one — but all 24 built-ins declare a cover set, because a theme that
declares nothing there picks its cover identically to every other silent
theme, which is the sameness the field exists to break. Every builtin locks
that cover set to its board face.

See `docs/concepts.md` for the fuller theme/layout/component/narrative
vocabulary this section assumes.
