    // sweep costing ~4s alone lands near 15s in company. At the old limit

    // the limit and that same run finishes in 10.2s, which is what rules out
    // a hang: a hang does not finish. `rally` is the heaviest because its
    // motif draws particle strokes, ~156k custom-geometry points per deck
    // against ~40 for a typical theme.
    //
    // 60s keeps ~3.5x headroom over the worst measured run and still surfaces
    // a real hang loudly (the whole suite takes 85-140s).
