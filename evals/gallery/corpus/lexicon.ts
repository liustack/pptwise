/**
 * Review-corpus vocabulary, one entry per language track.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT `src/audit/stress-fixtures.ts`. Those decks
 * are pathological by design (that file says so in its own header: "do not
 * tune the renderers to make these fixtures look good"). They answer "does
 * anything overflow". The visual review answers a different question —
 * "does this look like something a person would send" — and needs the
 * opposite kind of input: ordinary, plausible, well-behaved content, the
 * length a real author actually writes.
 *
 * Every string here is real prose about one coherent fictional subject, so
 * a reviewer paging through 400 slides reads a consistent story instead of
 * re-orienting on every page. The three tracks are the same company:
 *
 * - `zh`    CloudSeek collaboration SaaS, Chinese quarterly business review
 * - `en`    the same company's board deck, English
 * - `mixed` the same company's platform-migration deck, CJK prose carrying
 *           Latin product/tech names inline — the script mix that actually
 *           breaks line-breaking, not an artificial alternation
 *
 * Pools are typed by role rather than by component. A builder asks for
 * "short nominal labels" or "one-line claims" and slices what it needs, so
 * adding a component costs one builder, not three hand-written blobs.
