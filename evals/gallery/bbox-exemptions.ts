/**
 * Overflows the real-geometry pass is expected to report, because the design
 * asks for them.
 *
 * A few layouts deliberately let a glyph run past the box that holds it — a
 * chapter page's oversized ordinal is drawn as a graphic element, sized to
 * bleed off its own type box on purpose. `collectBBoxOverflows` measures ink
 * against declared boxes and cannot tell a designed bleed from a defect, so
 * the distinction is kept here instead.
 *
 * Why here and not as a `data-bleed` attribute on the element: marking it in
 * the renderer would change rendered SVG bytes, and those bytes are pinned by
 * committed goldens and preview files. This list keeps the audit honest
 * without a render-side change. If a `data-bleed` attribute is ever added to
 * the renderer for its own reasons, these entries become redundant and should
 * go.
 *
 * Each entry is deliberately narrow — a layout id *plus* the text that is
 * allowed to bleed. A blanket per-layout exemption would hide the next real
 * defect that lands on the same page.
