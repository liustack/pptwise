/**
 * `pnpm gallery --bbox` — the real-geometry pass over the pages the gallery
 * just rendered.
 *
 * Every other automated check in this repo measures text with
 * `measureTextUnits`, the same estimator the layout code uses to decide how
 * much text fits a box. That shared source is a blind spot: when the estimate
 * is wrong, the layout and the audit are wrong together and agree with each
 * other. `src/audit/browser-audit.ts` exists to break the tie by asking a
 * real browser for `getBBox()` — it was written for a consumer
 * (`scripts/pptx-browser-audit.mts`) that was never committed, so until now
 * nothing had ever run it against real pages.
 *
 * This is that consumer, attached to the gallery because the gallery already
 * renders the whole corpus through the real chain. It is opt-in: `pnpm check`
 * must never need a browser, so nothing here is imported unless `--bbox` is
 * passed, and Playwright is resolved at runtime rather than declared as a
 * dependency.
 *
 * Two caveats worth knowing before reading a finding:
 *
 * - Results depend on the fonts installed on the machine. A theme asking for
 *   a font this machine does not have gets a substitute with different
 *   metrics, so a finding is evidence about *this* machine's rendering — the
 *   same caveat the PowerPoint output carries.
 * - A designed bleed looks exactly like an overflow from here. Those are
 *   listed in `bbox-exemptions.ts` rather than suppressed by the renderer.

 * disagreement as clean on a narrow box and as a defect on a wide one. The
 * corpus shows exactly that: a full-width Chinese serif line runs 3px past a
 * 435px column and 6px past a 1088px column — 0.69% and 0.55%, one cause,

 *
 * So the horizontal allowance is proportional. The cap keeps it from growing
 * into a blindfold on the widest boxes: 8px on a 1280px canvas is still
 * invisible, and anything past it gets reported whatever its ratio.

 * None of this applies vertically. A baseline that sits too low is not an
