/**
 * The machine-readable half of a preview bundle.
 *
 * `pptpress preview` has always written per-slide SVG files and a
 * self-contained `preview.html`. Both are for eyes: one needs a file browser
 * to make sense of, the other needs a browser window. Neither tells a
 * *program* what it is looking at — which page is which, what the slide
 * dimensions are, which pages the audit flagged — so every consumer that
 * wanted to show a deck had to either re-render it or scrape the HTML.
 *
 * `manifest.json` is that missing piece, and it is deliberately small: a
 * flat page list with stable ids, the file each page lives in, and the
 * audit findings already computed for it. A harness with its own UI reads
 * this and draws whatever it likes; a harness without one opens the HTML
 * next to it; nothing has to re-implement the renderer to do either. That
 * split — one producer, several consumers, no second rendering path — is
 * the whole point, and it is why this file describes files on disk rather
 * than embedding anything itself.
 *
 * Pure data assembly, no `fs`: `runPreview` (`./commands.ts`) writes it, the
 * same division of labour `./preview-html.ts` already keeps.
