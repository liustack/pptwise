 * rationale, this is its Node-only counterpart for the ingestion form
 * `validateIr` itself can't reach): every file's bytes are read once here
 * regardless of extension, then a zero-byte file is rejected loud
 * immediately (`dr/d-robustness.md`'s zero-byte-PNG probe — previously this
 * silently produced a 0-byte media part in the exported .pptx). For the four
 * extensions {@link MIME_BY_EXT} recognizes, the bytes are additionally
 * magic-byte-sniffed ({@link sniffImageFormat}) and checked against what the
 * extension claims: a corrupt/unrecognized header is rejected
 * (garbage-bytes-PNG probe), and so is a mismatch — a real PNG saved as
 * `.jpg` (the third D3 probe) — same reject-not-silently-relabel disposition
 * `checkAssetBytes` documents, for the same reason: an extension/content
 * mismatch would otherwise land in the exported package as a media part
 * whose declared type and actual bytes disagree, which `package-audit.ts`'s
 * structural rules never check. A file whose extension isn't one of those
 * four (webp and friends) skips the sniff/mismatch check and keeps taking
 * the `recodeImageToPng` path below unconditionally — sharp decodes by
 * content, not extension, so a mislabeled-but-decodable file there is
 * already harmless, and a genuinely corrupt one surfaces as sharp's own
 * decode error.
