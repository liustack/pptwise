 * `../spec/assemble.ts`'s `assembleDeck`, zero-fs by design (`AGENTS.md`'s
 * layout rule: this module is the *only* place that reads `deck.spec.json`
 * / `pages/*.json` / `assets/*` off disk and calls straight through to it,
 * the same posture `./load-ir.ts` already holds for a single IR file). It
 * is also the only place that *writes* `assets/*`, on the disassemble side
 * ({@link writeDeckAssets}) — the mirror image of {@link scanAssets} below,
 * and the CLI-shell half of `disassembleDeck`'s otherwise-lossy asset
 * handling (see that function's own doc comment in `../spec/assemble.ts`).
 *
 * Directory layout (spec §6/§7 — the locked artifact renamed from
 * `deck.plan.json` to `deck.spec.json`, vocabulary-v4 rename, task 2):
 * ```
 * my-deck/
 *   deck.spec.json        the locked spec — page order's sole source of truth
 *   pages/<page-id>.json  one file per filled page, content only (no type/heading)
 *   assets/                local images, auto-registered by filename
 * ```
 *
 * A directory carrying the retired `deck.plan.json` only (no
 * `deck.spec.json`) is not a current deck project — {@link readSpecFile}
 * reports that directories now use `deck.spec.json`. A directory carrying
 * both files at once is a hard error ({@link readSpecFile} below) — spec
 * §9.2: "目录中同时出现 `deck.plan.json` 和 `deck.spec.json` 时应硬报错，

 * locally-resolvable path always wins over the bare-name interpretation,
 * but is never handed back unresolved: every downstream fs call (Node's
 * `readFile` et al.) always resolves a relative path against the process's
 * *real* `process.cwd()`, which only coincides with this function's `cwd`
 * parameter in production (`commands.ts` never passes one explicitly, so it

 * not the bare `arg`, or the caller's next fs call would silently resolve
 * against a completely different, real cwd. An absolute `arg` is unaffected
 * either way — `path.resolve` returns an absolute later segment as-is.
 *
 * Otherwise `arg` is treated as a deck name under `decksRoot(config)`

 * but only when that candidate actually exists. When *neither* the local
 * path nor the deck-home candidate exists, this returns the local
 * (cwd-resolved) path rather than the deck-home guess: a bare arg that was
 * actually a typo'd local filename (`pptwise validate typo.json`) should
 * have its eventual "cannot read" error name the file the user typed, not
 * an unrelated `~/.pptwise/decks/typo.json` path they never meant. `config`
 * is not either config layer's raw shape — it is the already-resolved
 * effective `decksDir` source (project `pptwise.config.json`'s own value,
 * spec §7's project-level escape hatch, W5 task 6, when it sets one, else
 * the user config's, `./config.ts`'s `UserPptwiseConfig`) computed once by

 * already resolved to an absolute path when it came from the project layer
 * — this function itself has no reason to know there were ever two
 * possible layers or bases, only the final answer. The caller fetches both
 * config files at most once per command and passes them in rather than
 * this function reaching for either itself, so a command that already
 * needs one of them for other reasons (theme/style resolution) never reads
 * the same file twice.
 *
 * An empty or whitespace-only `arg` (W5 whole-branch review finding 4) is
 * rejected up front rather than silently resolving to `cwd` itself — without
 * this guard, `resolve(cwd, "")` returns `cwd` unchanged and `pathExists`
 * always finds it (a directory always exists), so the empty string would
