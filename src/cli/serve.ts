/**
 * `pptwise serve <target>` (serve wave, task S1, spec-plan.md
 * `.issues/2026-07-25-serve/spec-plan.md`): a live-reloading HTTP preview of
 * the exact same `preview.html` bundle `pptwise preview --html` writes to
 * disk (`buildDeckPreview`, `./commands.ts`) — this module never builds its
 * own HTML, only serves and refreshes what that shared pipeline produces
 * (design ruling 5: "buildPreviewHtml 复用现状 ... 禁止 fork 一份 preview 构建
 * 逻辑").
 *
 * Two layers:
 * - {@link createServeServer}: the testable factory — a plain `node:http`
 *   server (design ruling 1: zero new dependencies, no express/ws/chokidar)
 *   bound hard to `127.0.0.1` (design ruling 6: no remote bind, no auth — a
 *   local dev tool), an `fs.watch`-based rebuild loop, and an SSE channel for
 *   push (design ruling 2: v1 is a whole-page `location.reload()` over SSE,
 *   no partial DOM patching). No process-level side effects (no `SIGINT`
 *   handler, no browser launch) — a caller (tests, or {@link runServe} below)
 *   owns that, which is what keeps this factory usable outside the CLI.
 * - {@link runServe}: the CLI-facing wrapper — prints the URL, opens a
 *   browser unless `--no-open`, wires `SIGINT` to a clean shutdown.
 *
 * Routes: `GET /` returns the in-memory cached HTML — after {@link injectServeClient}
 * has spliced this module's own `<script>` into it (task S2; see that
 * function's own doc comment) — rebuilt on change, never per-request (a
 * request never blocks on a render). `GET /events` is the SSE stream: a
 * `retry:` hint on connect, a `: heartbeat` comment frame every 30s (keeps
 * the connection alive through an idle-timeout proxy — pure SSE comment
 * syntax, invisible to `EventSource`), an `event: reload` frame after every
 * successful rebuild, an `event: error` frame with a JSON `{message}` body
 * after a failed one. Everything else 404s.
 *
 * This server is read-only. It carried a `POST /revision-request` endpoint
 * until 2026-08-16, which took the preview annotation panel's export and
 * wrote it into the deck directory; the panel went first, leaving the
 * endpoint with no producer, and the pair was removed together. A reviewer
 * who wants something changed says so in the conversation — a screenshot
 * reaches the agent faster than a panel whose output has to be exported and
 * routed back — and the agent edits `pages/*.json` through the same gate as
 * every other change.
 *
 * Watch roots (design ruling 3) come straight from {@link buildDeckPreview}'s
 * own `resolvedTarget`/`isDir` — the exact path `loadDeckTarget`
 * (`./commands.ts`) already resolved `target` to — rather than this module
 * re-deriving the bare-name/`decksDir` resolution a second time: a deck
 * project directory watches `deck.spec.json` + `pages/` + `assets/` +
 * `theme.json` (non-recursive `fs.watch` on each — these flat, non-nested
 * paths cover the whole deck-project layout anyway, `docs/deck-projects.md`, so
 * `{recursive: true}` buys nothing here even now that the repo's floor
 * (Node 22.19, `package.json#engines`) has it on every platform); a bare IR
 * target watches that one file, plus `--theme-file` when set. Multiple `fs.watch` events firing for a
 * single logical save (editors that write via a temp file + rename, or
 * saving several page files in one "save all") are coalesced by a 200ms
 * debounce into one rebuild.
 *
 * Resilience (design ruling 3's other half): a rebuild that throws — a
 * mid-edit malformed JSON save is the common case — never crashes the server
 * or throws out of the watch handler. It's caught, turned into an `error` SSE
 * event, and the previous good `html` stays cached and keeps serving `GET /`
 * until a later rebuild succeeds. Only the *first* build (at
 * `createServeServer` call time, before the server starts listening) is
 * allowed to reject the whole call — same "throw `PptwiseError` → CLI exit 1"
 * contract every other `run*` command already has (`./commands.ts`), since
 * there is no previous-good HTML yet to fall back to.

 * The serve-mode client (task S2), spliced into every served page by

 * --html` download path. Two jobs:
 *
 * 1. Live reload: opens `EventSource('/events')`, reloads the whole page on
 *    `reload` (design ruling 2), shows a fixed top banner on `error`. The
 *    server's own custom `event: error` frame and `EventSource`'s *built-in*
 *    connection-failure event share the same DOM event name on this one
 *    object — a real connection hiccup is a plain `Event` with no `data`
 *    (EventSource auto-reconnects itself off the server's `retry:` hint,
 *    nothing for this page to do); the server's frame is a `MessageEvent`
 *    whose `data` is a JSON `{message}` string. Checking for `.data` first
 *    tells the two apart. No explicit "clear the banner" path either: every
 *    successful rebuild's `reload` does a full `location.reload()`, wiping
 *    the banner along with the rest of the DOM — a separate hide-on-success
 *    branch would be dead code a reload always beats to it.
 *
 * 2. Revision-request submit: rewires the existing export/download button
 *    (`#pf-export-btn`, `buildPreviewHtml`/`./preview-html.ts`) to POST
 *    instead of only downloading. The exact serialized payload comes from
 *    `window.__pptwiseBuildExportBlob` — a plain function reference that
 *    file's own `<script>` closure assigns onto `window` specifically as
 *    this module's seam (see that file's own doc comment for the full
 *    rationale; design ruling 5 forbids a second copy of any part of the
 *    preview-build logic, and calling back into the original closure's own
 *    function is how this reuses it instead of re-deriving the
 *    `{version, deck, requests}` shape here). Called through
 *    `Promise.resolve(...).then(...)` rather than invoked and trusted
 *    directly — cheap insurance that both a synchronous throw *and* a
 *    rejected/async return from `buildExportBlob()` land in the same
 *    `.catch` as a network failure, all surfaced as the same inline
 *    status-line feedback, never a silent no-op. (An earlier version of
 *    this file took a different approach here — briefly monkey-patching
 *    `URL.createObjectURL`/`HTMLAnchorElement.prototype.click` around a
 *    programmatic click on the original button, to capture the `Blob` it
 *    built without a seam existing yet. Reviewed out: it only worked
 *    because that handler happened to be perfectly synchronous start to
 *    finish, an assumption a later change to it — one `await` — could
 *    silently break with zero user-visible error, on the one feature this
 *    whole command exists to make possible.) The rewired button (a
 *    `cloneNode` swapped in for the original — `cloneNode` never copies
 *    `addEventListener` listeners, so the original element, though detached
 *    from the document, keeps `buildPreviewHtml`'s own listener intact and
 *    still runnable via `.click()`) shows success/failure inline; a small
 *    secondary link next to it just calls `originalBtn.click()` — the
 *    untouched, real download path — so a manual copy is always still one
 *    click away regardless of whether the POST succeeds.
 *
 * Exported (S3, S2 re-review's named test carry) purely so
 * `serve-client.test.ts` can execute this exact string under jsdom instead of
 * only grepping it as markup — this file has no other export consumer, isn't
 * re-exported from anywhere `pptwise --help` or the SDK's public surface ever
 * reads, and stays exactly as inert to import as before: `src/cli/serve.ts`
 * is already Node-only (AGENTS.md's layout rule), never reachable from
 * `src/index.ts`'s browser-safe closure regardless of what it exports.
