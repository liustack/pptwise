// Node below the floor, a missing optional capability, a broken render chain,
// or a user config file that is group/other-readable. Each of those gets its
// own check below.
//
// The split is deliberate (ported from modlens's own doctor): buildDoctorReport
// produces a structured report and never prints, renderDoctorReport turns that
// report into text. `--json` hands the structure straight through, and the
// tests assert against the structure instead of scraping formatted output.
