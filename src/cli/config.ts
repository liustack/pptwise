/**
 * Project-level deck defaults. Precedence (spec §7's four-layer chain, W5
 * task 5): CLI flag > project config (this schema, cwd walk-up) > user
 * config (`UserConfigSchema` below) > whatever the artifact itself already
 * carries (an authored IR's own `theme`, or the schema's own "consulting"
 * default when nothing anywhere sets one) — see `commands.ts`'s
 * `applyDeckConfig` for where all four layers actually get merged. `theme`
 * is kept an open string at this schema layer (mirrors `ThemeSchema` in
 * `ir/index.ts`) on purpose: `readConfigFile` below no longer checks it
 * against the installed set at read time — a config file's theme value
 * might sit behind a CLI flag or another layer that never actually gets
 * used, so rejecting it here would hard-fail a command over a value that
 * was never going to apply. `applyDeckConfig` runs that check once, at
 * resolution time, against whichever layer's value actually wins the chain
 * — the same "unknown → PptwiseError with the available list" UX as
 * `validateIr`, just applied to the resolved value instead of unconditionally
 * to every layer.
 *
 * `decksDir` (W5 task 6, spec §7: a team that wants deck project
 * directories checked into the repo instead of living under
 * `~/.pptwise/decks` declares it here): a relative value resolves against
 * *this config file's own directory* (wherever `findConfig`'s cwd walk-up
 * found it) — never the CLI's cwd, and never `pptwiseHome()`. Wins over the
 * user config's own `decksDir` (`UserConfigSchema` below) when both are
 * set, same project-beats-user precedence as `theme`/`style` above. The two
 * layers resolve against different bases, so this schema alone can't
 * express the final answer — `commands.ts`'s `resolveDecksDirSource`
 * computes the already-resolved absolute path before handing it down to
 * `./deck-dir.ts`'s `resolveDeckTarget` / `./home.ts`'s `decksRoot`, neither
 * of which knows there are two possible bases, only the final one.
 *
 * `outDir` (workspace-artifacts wave): where `render`/`preview` write when
 * the caller passes no `-o`. Default `.pptwise` under this config file's own
 * directory (`../cli/workspace.ts`'s `WORKSPACE_DIRNAME`); a relative value
 * here resolves against that same directory, an absolute one passes through.
 * Setting it at all is also the opt-out from the automatic git-exclude line
 * — a project that names its own artifact directory has already decided how
 * that directory is tracked (`prepareWorkspaceDir`). Project layer only, on
 * purpose: an artifact root is a property of *this project's* working tree,
 * not of the user's identity, so it deliberately has no counterpart in
 * {@link UserConfigSchema} below — a user-level `outDir` would collapse every
 * project's artifacts into one directory.

 * User-level config schema (spec §7's four-layer chain — the layer between
 * project config and the artifact's own value): the same three deck-default
 * fields as {@link ConfigSchema} (`theme`/`style`/`decksDir`), plus optional
 * `images` (Pexels/Pixabay keys and Openverse OAuth for stock-photo search). `outDir` is
 * deliberately absent — an artifact root belongs to this working tree, not
 * to the user's identity (see {@link ConfigSchema}'s own `outDir` comment).
 * `images` is user-layer only: project {@link ConfigSchema} rejects it so a
 * repo file cannot carry API keys.
 * `decksDir` is no longer project-config-free as of W5 task 6 (see
 * {@link ConfigSchema}'s own doc comment on that field), but the two layers
 * still resolve it against different bases: this user layer always resolves
 * against `pptwiseHome()` (`./home.ts`'s `decksRoot`, this layer's one fixed
 * location), the project layer against the project config file's own
 * directory. Declared as its own flat object literal rather than
 * `ConfigSchema.extend(...)` — a shape this small is not worth taking on
 * zod's extend-then-restrict chaining, and it keeps both schemas readable
 * independently.
 *
 * `decksDir`: a relative value resolves against this config file's own
 * directory (`./home.ts`'s `pptwiseHome()` — the only directory a user
 * config can ever live in, see `decksRoot`), never the CLI's cwd. No tilde
 * expansion — a literal `~/decks` is the literal relative path segment
 * `~/decks` under that base, not the home directory. The resulting (almost
 * certainly missing) directory surfaces through whatever downstream error
 * reads it, same as any other bad path.
