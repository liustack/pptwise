/**
 * Pure string builder for `pptwise preview --html`'s self-contained review
 * bundle (v0.3 W7 task 1, spec §7 workflow ⑤): one `preview.html` with every
 * slide's already-rendered SVG (`renderSlideSvg`, `../api.ts`) inlined
 * directly into the markup, a bottom thumbnail filmstrip, keyboard (←/→) and
 * click navigation, and a page counter. No `fs` here on purpose — this
 * module only assembles a string; `runPreview` (`./commands.ts`) is the only
 * caller and the only place that touches disk, which keeps this file
 * trivially unit-testable (feed it slide data, assert on the returned
 * string) despite living under the Node-only `src/cli*` tree (AGENTS.md's
 * "no Node-only deps" layout rule is about `src/index.ts`'s own dependency
 * closure, not every file under `src/cli` — this one just happens to need
 * none anyway).
 *
 * Self-containment (the plan's hard requirement): every slide's SVG is
 * embedded as raw markup — never `<img src>`, never any other reference to
 * an external file — and the only CSS/JS in the document is inlined in
 * `<style>`/`<script>`. Local image assets are already `data:` URIs by the
 * time `runPreview` calls `renderSlideSvg` (`resolveLocalAssets`'s job,
 * `./load-ir.ts` — this module never touches assets itself) — *assuming*
 * every image asset the deck references is local or already a `data:` URI.
 * Known limitation: `resolveLocalAssets` deliberately passes a remote
 * `http(s):` asset `src` through untouched (the export pipeline inlines
 * those itself), so that src is left un-inlined and lands verbatim in this
 * bundle's embedded SVG as a live network reference, not a namespace URI —
 * breaking the zero-network-request guarantee for that one slide. Barring
 * that case, the only `http(s)` substrings that can appear anywhere in the
 * output are SVG namespace URIs (`xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`,
 * emitted by `../svg/serialize.ts` on every slide) — XML namespace
 * identifiers, not network requests.
 *
 * Embed strategy (one `<svg>` per slide, not two): the thumbnail filmstrip
 * and the large "stage" view share the exact same DOM node per slide rather
 * than each holding its own copy — duplicating every slide's SVG (including
 * any inlined `data:` image payloads) would double the file's byte size for
 * an image-heavy deck for zero benefit, since only one size is ever on
 * screen for a given slide at a time. The one node that exists for a slide
 * lives in exactly one of two homes: `#pf-stage` (the slide currently being
 * viewed large) or its own `.pf-thumb-slot` (every other slide, shown small
 * in the filmstrip) — `<script>`'s `activate()` moves it between the two
 * with a plain `appendChild` (which detaches a node from its previous parent
 * automatically) when the viewer clicks a thumbnail or presses ←/→. Because
 * an inactive slide's badge travels with its node, and the active slide's
 * thumbnail button carries its own always-present badge, a placeholder page
 * still shows its "unfilled" mark in both places even though only one copy
 * of the slide's markup ever exists.
 *
 * Audit overlay + annotations (notes+preview wave, task 2): `buildPreviewHtml`
 * is still a pure renderer — `findings` (`../svg/audit/deck-audit.ts`'s
 * `AuditFinding`, reshaped locally as {@link PreviewHtmlFinding} so this file
 * still has no `../ir`/`../svg` import) and the placeholder-skip
 * {@link PreviewHtmlInput.auditNote} both arrive as plain input, the same way
 * `slides` already does; the caller (`runPreview`, `./commands.ts`) decides
 * *whether* to run `auditDeck` at all (skipped whenever the deck has any
 * placeholder page — a placeholder has nothing to audit and `auditDeck`
 * itself silently skips it, so surfacing a half-audited deck as if it were
 * clean would be misleading; the plan's contract is "any placeholder present
 * → skip the whole overlay, one-line notice instead"). Per-page finding
 * counts (thumbnail/stage badges) and the findings panel are rendered as
 * static markup at build time, not computed by client-side JS from the
 * embedded JSON — `findings` is known up front here, so there is nothing for
 * the browser to compute; the embedded `<script type="application/json"
 * id="pf-audit-findings">` blob exists only so a saved `preview.html` still
 * carries the structured findings for later tooling, not to drive the UI.
 * User content still flows through {@link escapeHtml} everywhere it lands in
 * HTML (a finding's `message` embeds a truncated quote of the offending
 * slide's own text) — the JSON blob instead goes through {@link embedJson},
 * which additionally neutralizes any literal `</script` sequence a slide's
 * text could contain (escaping every `<` to its unicode escape — valid
 * inside a JSON string, and the only character the HTML tokenizer would
 * otherwise use to end the `<script>` element early), the standard technique
 * for safely inlining untrusted JSON into a script tag.
 *
 * Annotations were removed on 2026-08-16, along with the "Export revision
 * requests" download and the `window.__pptwiseBuildExportBlob` seam that
 * `pptwise serve` used to POST the same payload to disk. The page shows the
 * deck and nothing else: a reviewer who wants something changed says so in
 * the conversation, usually with a screenshot, which reaches the agent
 * faster than typing into a panel whose output then has to be exported and
 * read back. `preview-html.test.ts` pins the absence so it cannot return as
 * a half-feature.
