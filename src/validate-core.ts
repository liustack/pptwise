 * (`src/index.ts`'s dependency-closure rule). An `http(s)://` src is left
 * untouched here too, but not because it's out of scope for byte
 * validation — it's checked at a *different, later* seam on purpose:
 * `validateIr` never makes a network request (a deliberate, unconditional
 * boundary — no fetch, ever, from validate), so a remote asset's bytes
 * simply don't exist yet at this point in the pipeline. `inlinePptxAssets`
 * (`platform/inline-assets.ts`) is where the URL actually turns into bytes
 * (its own `fetch` call, export time) — that function's
 * `assertValidFetchedImageBytes` runs this exact same sniff on what comes
 * back, right after the fetch, so the byte check still happens, just later
 * and at the seam where there's something to check. All three ingestion
 * forms therefore end up sniffed exactly once, each at the earliest point
 * its bytes actually exist — nowhere in the chain is an `http(s)` asset's
 * validity left permanently unchecked.
 *
 * Extension/declared-MIME-vs-bytes mismatch disposition: reject, not
 * silently trust the sniffed bytes and rewrite the MIME. A
 * `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` URI whose payload is actually PNG-encoded
 * would otherwise flow untouched into `svg2pptx/image.ts`'s `<image>` op and
 * land in the exported package under a JPEG media-part identity with PNG
 * bytes inside it — exactly the extension/content mismatch the repair-dialog
 * probe (`docs/testing.md`) exists to catch, and `package-audit.ts`'s 8
 * structural rules never check media-part byte validity at all (`dr/
 * d-robustness.md` again — this is the gap that let it through before).
 * Silently rewriting the MIME instead would make that specific risk
 * disappear without ever telling the caller their source data was
 * mislabeled — for an AI-agent-facing SDK, bytes that don't match their
 * claimed format is itself a signal something upstream went wrong (wrong
 * file selected, a failed re-encode) that the caller needs surfaced, not
 * quietly reinterpreted out from under them.

/**
 * Validate raw JSON against the IR schema, then — once it parses — resolve
 * `narrative` (`resolveNarrative`, spec §5: an unrecognized preset name is a
 * `narrative`-path error, page-less) and run the content-quality gate
 * (`checkIrQuality`, passed the resolved axes) against the parsed IR. Every
 * hard-gate stage (schema, theme id, layout applicability, full-body
 * exclusivity, boundary-page content, duplicate ids, asset bytes, narrative)
 * must pass for `ok: true`, same as before. Quality findings are reported
 * the same way as schema errors (page-scoped, 1-based).
 *
 * Dual-threshold severity (borrow wave, Task 2 — recalibrated from the prior
 * "any finding blocks" design): `checkIrQuality`'s own "warn" vs "error" tag
 * is now respected, not flattened. Only "error"-severity findings
 * (`empty_deck`, `bullet_item_overflow` — content genuinely lost: an empty
 * deck, or a bullet item long enough to hit `bullets.tsx`'s MIN_FONT floor
 * and actually get truncated) gate `ok`. "warn"-severity findings — the
 * editorial-budget codes (`missing_heading`/`long_heading`/`density`/
 * `bullets_overflow`/`bullet_item_long`/`big_number_no_kpi`) — surface on
 * {@link ValidateResult.warnings} instead: visible to every caller (the SDK,
 * the CLI's `validate`/`render` pre-flight), never blocking. This reverses
 * the prior posture (this comment used to read "any finding blocks... not
 * only 'error'-severity ones") because the evidence behind it did not hold:
 * a boundary scan (borrow-wave fact-report, Q3) found the editorial bullets
 * threshold blocking content roughly 3.5x below where `bullets.tsx`'s own
 * render safety net (2-line wrap, shrink to a 14px floor) actually starts
 * losing characters — so the hard gate was rejecting deck content that
 * would have rendered with zero visible defect, and a tight hard gate on an
 * editorial (not geometric) threshold taught truncate-content-to-pass
 * workarounds rather than catching real loss. `generatePptx`'s default path
 * inherits this unchanged (`if (!v.ok) throw`) — it already only ever
 * blocked on `ok`, never inspected `errors`/`warnings` directly.
 *
 * Before any of that, two deterministic pre-parse rewrite passes run, each
 * threading its rewrite notes onto `ValidateResult.normalized` on *every*
 * return path below via `withNormalized`, success or failure alike — neither
 * ever gates `ok` on its own:
 *  - {@link normalizeComponentAliases} (W5 task 4): the component
 *    field-name synonym rescue (kpi `title`→`label`, blockquote
 *    `content`→`text`,
 *    …), scoped to `slides[]`. Only rewrites where the canonical key is
 *    absent, so the schema parse below never sees an alias as an
 *    "unrecognized key" in the first place.
 *  - {@link normalizeNarrativeShape} (`./narrative`, T0b bench-evidence fix
 *    2 — see its own doc comment for the full rationale): the root-level
 *    `narrative: {id: <preset>}` shape rescue. A model that just wrote
 *    `theme: {id: "consulting"}` a few lines above pattern-matches the same
 *    wrapper shape onto `narrative`; this rewrites it to the bare preset
 *    string `resolveNarrative`'s string branch actually expects. Fires only
 *    when `id` is the object's sole narrative-relevant key (none of
 *    strategy/pacing/audience alongside it) — a mixed shape stays
 *    unrescued, ambiguous, and hard-errors exactly as it did before this
 *    pass existed.
 *
 * Both are the same class of fix — a weak-model *synonym* rescue (a name
 * drift for the component-alias pass, a *shape* drift for the narrative
 * pass) — which is the actual boundary the next paragraph's "no
 * old-vocabulary rescue" draws, not "no rewrite ever touches `narrative`."
 *
 * IR versions 1 through 4 are rejected before normalization or schema
 * parsing. The error states the current v5 contract and intentionally offers
 * no compatibility rewrite or migration command.
