// Leaf module — no imports. Shared enum value tuples for the three narrative
// axes (strategy / pacing / audience, spec §5, renamed from
// mode/delivery/audience per the vocabulary-v4 wave — spec §8.1's rename
// table and §4's value table).
//
// `src/narrative` (the `Strategy`/`Pacing`/`Audience` types, `resolveNarrative`'s
// runtime validation) reads these tuples from here rather than owning them
// directly. This package's IR schema (`./index.ts`) originally read them too
// (the `narrative` field's axes-object shape used to enum-close per axis
// right at the schema layer) — the W3 task-2 review fix loosened that branch
// to a plain open record (schema now only distinguishes string vs. object,
// `resolveNarrative` is the sole semantic authority), so `./index.ts` no
// longer imports from here. This still stays a separate leaf module rather
// than folding into `src/narrative` directly: `src/narrative/index.test.ts`
// already imports `BUILTIN_THEME_IDS` from `src/ir` (every preset's
// `themeRecommendations` is checked against it), so `src/ir` importing these
// axis tuples *from* `src/narrative` would risk a real cycle the day
// scenario's runtime code (not just its test) needs something from `src/ir`
// too — and `src/ir` reading them again in the future (another schema-layer
// enum, a JSON-schema description, ...) is not unlikely. A neutral leaf
// module with zero imports sidesteps the direction question entirely —
// neither module depends on the other.
//
// File renamed `scenario-values.ts` → `narrative-values.ts` in the
// vocabulary-v4 rename (task 1): not itself one of spec §8.1's named public
// symbols, but this leaf module's entire content is the narrative axis value
// tuples, so its filename follows the same rename for internal consistency.
// Only two importers (`src/narrative/index.ts`, `src/layouts/registry.ts`
// — both updated in the same commit), no external/public path reference.

// Page-level `beat` vocabulary (P1 variety wave, task 1 — "beat wired into
// selection"). Not one of the three narrative *axes* above (beat is a
// per-page authoring value, not a deck-level `NarrativeProfile` field) but
// shares this leaf module for the identical reason: `src/ir` (SlideSchema's
// `beat` field, `./index.ts`) and `src/spec` (PageSpecSchema's own `beat`
// field, `../spec/index.ts`) both need the exact same three-value tuple, and
// `src/spec` already imports from `src/ir`, so `src/ir` importing the tuple
// back from `src/spec` would be the cycle this module exists to avoid (see
// this file's own top comment). Distinct from `StrategyDefinition.beatPolicy`
// (`src/narrative/index.ts`) — that is a *per-strategy rotation rule* name
// ("anchor-open", "alternate", ...), a different five-value vocabulary that
// shares no members with this one. Values unchanged from the pre-vocabulary-v4
// "rhythm" field (spec §2.3/§4.3/§8.1's rename table): `anchor` (single bold
// statement), `dense` (high information density), `breathing` (generous
// whitespace, unhurried single flow).
