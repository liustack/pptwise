/**
 * Borrow-wave task 3's "sweep which other large enums exist" requirement,
 * made durable — review-round strengthening. The flagship bug (a 24,910-char,
 * 1756-option wall) was possible because `z.enum(PPTX_ICON_NAMES)` pulled its
 * candidate list from a large *external* constant with no message
 * customization. A first version of this file only regex-scanned the schema
 * *source text* for inline `z.enum([...])` literal arrays plus a hardcoded
 * name-check for the two known call sites — real coverage for "a new large
 * inline enum", but blind to the exact shape of the original bug: a new
 * large enum sourced from a new external constant would match neither check
 * (not an inline literal array, not one of the two hardcoded names) and pass
 * silently.
 *
 * This version instead walks the *constructed* schema object tree
 * ({@link walkSchema}) — introspecting the actual zod schema instances via
 * zod v4's internal `_zod.def` representation, not the source text — finds
 * every enum/discriminated-union node regardless of where its candidate list
 * came from, and behaviorally probes each large one by feeding it an
 * obviously-invalid value and checking the *real* resulting message length.
 * A new large enum, inline or externally sourced, with or without a custom
 * error map, is caught the same way.
 *
 * Trade-off, stated honestly rather than left implicit: `_zod.def` is zod's
 * internal representation, not a documented public API — a future zod
 * version could reshape it in a way {@link walkSchema} doesn't recognize.
 * That failure mode is guarded, not silent: {@link walkSchema} records every
 * `def.type` it doesn't know how to descend into, and the first test below
 * asserts that set is empty — an unrecognized construct fails the sweep
 * loudly (as "go update the walker") rather than quietly under-counting.

 * constant. `unhandled` collects any `def.type` this walker doesn't know how
 * to descend into (see this file's own top comment) — a non-empty set means
 * the walk may have missed something under an unrecognized construct, which
 * this file's first test turns into a hard failure rather than a silent gap.
 * `seen` guards against infinite recursion on a self-referential schema
