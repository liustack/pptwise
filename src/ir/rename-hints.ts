/**
 * Unrecognized-key rescue hints (borrow-wave task 3, generalizing the
 * `scenario` → `narrative` rescue that already lived inline in
 * `../api.ts`'s `validateIr`). Two independent, table-driven mechanisms:
 *
 * 1. {@link RENAME_HINTS} — the rest of the documented v2/v3 → v4 field
 *    renames (the same mapping `validateIr`'s own v2/v3 hard-reject messages
 *    already spell out in full) get the same "this was renamed, here's the
 *    new name" treatment `scenario` already had, instead of a bare zod
 *    "Unrecognized key" that gives a weak model no path to self-correct
 *    (borrow-wave B report §3.3 #4). Scoped by *where* the rename happened
 *    (`at`), not just the bare key name, so an unrelated field that happens
 *    to reuse one of these names elsewhere in the tree is never
 *    mis-diagnosed as this rename — e.g. a component-level field named
 *    `override` (none exists today, but the table's shape guards against it)
 *    would not collide with `theme.override`.
 * 2. {@link slideLevelUnknownKeyHint} — a generic, non-field-specific hint
 *    for an unrecognized key directly on a `Slide` object that *isn't* one of
 *    the known renames: content fields almost always belong inside one of
 *    the slide's `components[]` entries, not at slide level (borrow-wave B
 *    report §3.3 #3, the `items`-on-slide probe). Deliberately generic
 *    (one hint, not a per-field table) — the plan's own scope line: "keep it
 *    generic/table-driven, not per-field hardcoding beyond what the rename
 *    map already gives".
