// The equivalence-proof hard gate (vocabulary-v4 rename, task 1, spec §10/
// §12): a v3 deck migrated through `migrateIrV3ToV4` must render byte-for-
// byte identical SVG and PPTX output to what the *same* deck rendered on
// the pre-rename codebase (base commit 0511b8c, before any vocabulary-v4
// change landed).
//
// Durable form: `../ir/__fixtures__/equivalence-golden/*.json` is a one-time
// capture of that base-commit render (see the task-1 report for the capture
// method — a temporary script, deleted before this commit, that ran
// `V3_EQUIVALENCE_DECKS` through the pre-rename `PptxIRSchema` +
// `renderSlideSvg` + `generatePptxBlob` and wrote the output here). This
// test replays the exact same fixtures through the post-rename pipeline —
// `PptxIRV3Schema.parse` → `migrateIrV3ToV4` → the (now v4-only) render
// chain — and asserts the output is unchanged from that golden capture. A
// regression here means either the migration function or a render consumer
// silently changed behavior, not just vocabulary — the spec §10 violation
// this whole task's discipline exists to catch.
//
// PPTX comparison excludes `docProps/core.xml` (pptxgenjs bakes
// `new Date().toISOString()` into it on every export — the one genuinely
// nondeterministic zip part, unrelated to this task) — the same normalized-
// zip-map method `src/pptx/generate-notes-export.test.ts` already
// established for this repo's byte-comparison tests.

      //     `tone-adaptive-content`).
      //   - `scenarioBearing`: slide indices 0 and 4 (cover + ending, both
      //     auto-picked — storytelling's new identityTendencies pulling
      //     this seed onto `editorial-masthead`/`poster-ending`).

      //     `two-column`).
      //   - `scenarioBearing`: slide indices 2 and 3 (content, auto-picked
      //     — `tone-adaptive-content` -> `rail-numbered`, `stacked-poster`
      //     -> `quiet-frame`).

      //
      // Re-recaptured again (P1 variety wave, task 4 fix round — reviewer
      // Minor-1, quiet-frame's single-component symmetry fix): `content-
      // quiet-frame.tsx` now narrows+re-centers its content rect for
      // exactly 1 non-full-body component (640px, was the full 880px
      // symmetric rect) — a real, intended geometry fix, not a migration
      // regression. `scenarioBearing`'s own slide index 3 (the
      // `quiet-frame` content page landed above, exactly 1 paragraph
      // component) is the only slide in any of the three fixtures affected
      // — verified via the same targeted-diff discipline: `basic`/

      // Re-recaptured again (bold-metrics fix, 2026-07-24 — svg-text-

      // any of the three fixtures affected: its bold SimSun heading "A
      // quarter of steady wins" (`fontWeight="800"`) was fitting on one
      // line at fontSize 64 under the old unweighted estimate; the new
      // SimSun/KaiTi-aware estimate (this fix's item 2 -- the face's own
      // Regular-weight space/other gap, folded in regardless of bold --
      // plus its conservative-proxy Bold `lowerDigit` factor) now wraps it
      // to two ("A quarter of" / "steady wins") at the same fontSize 64 --
      // a real, intended shrink-safety change, not a migration regression.
      // Verified via the same targeted-diff discipline as every prior
      // recapture above: `basic`/`scenarioBearing` are untouched (neither
      // lands a bold Georgia/YaHei/SimSun/KaiTi heading close enough to its

      // `annualReviewPreset`'s SVG/PPTX goldens is this one heading's line
      // count and font-family-local geometry it displaces (the quote
      // block's `data-audit-box`/`data-audit-rect` y-coordinates shift down
      // to make room), and `.audit.json` needed no recapture (findings
      // stayed the empty array both sides).
      //
      // Re-recaptured a third time (bold-metrics fix round 2, same date --
      // controller-ordered upgrade from a class-average-plus-margin model
      // to an exact per-character advance model for Georgia/YaHei, after a
      // review found real headings that clipped straight through the
      // margin; see svg-text-layout.ts's EPITAPH comment). SimSun/KaiTi
      // were not upgraded to an exact model (that face's Latin glyphs have
      // zero measured per-character variance -- no class-average gap to
      // close the way Georgia/YaHei had one -- see `SIMSUN_KAITI`'s own
      // comment for the full argument), but did lose the same round-1
      // margin on `lowerDigit` that Georgia/YaHei's classes lost --
      // reverting it to the verbatim conservative-proxy factor undoes
      // exactly the previous recapture above: "A quarter of steady wins"
      // fits back onto one line at fontSize 64, matching what the
      // *original*, pre-round-1 golden had (round 1 wrapped it to two,
      // round 2 un-wraps it back to one -- not a coincidence: `SIMSUN_
      // KAITI`'s `lowerDigit` factor is 1.048 verbatim both before round 1
      // and again now, only round 1's brief middle state multiplied it by
      // the now-retired 1.2 margin). Same targeted-diff discipline: slide
      // index 3 is the only change anywhere in any of the three fixtures'
      // SVG/PPTX goldens, and `.audit.json` needed no recapture -- verified

      // Re-recaptured again (theme-structure wave, task T2 --
      // `.issues/2026-07-26-theme-structure/plan.md`): `consulting` and
      // `journal` (the two themes these three fixtures use) both picked up
      // a `layoutTendencies` declaration on cover/chapter/ending
      // (`../themes/definitions.ts`'s `LAYOUTS` table) -- a real, intended
      // selection-behavior change (design decision 2's whole point: the
      // theme layer is now a live weighting input to auto-picked
      // cover/chapter/ending layouts), not a migration regression. None
      // of these three decks pins every identity page's `layout`, so
      // reweighting the pool can legitimately flip a given seed's pick --
      // same posture as every recapture above. Exactly one slide changed
      // in each fixture (verified via a targeted-diff script, not just
      // "this file wasn't touched"):

      //   - `scenarioBearing` (`journal`): slide index 4 (ending, auto-
      //     picked) -- `poster-ending` -> `constellation-ending`. Not
      //     journal's own declared id (`masthead-ending`) -- a mechanical
      //     side effect of the same declaration: bumping `masthead-ending`'s
      //     weight 1 -> 3 grows the ending pool's total weight from 11 to
      //     13 (the pool already carries two weight-3 members from the
      //     strategy layer's own `identityTendencies`, so the base is 11,
      //     not the 7 an earlier draft of this comment stated),
      //     which shifts where this fixed seed's `target = hash % total`
      //     lands among the *other* candidates' boundaries too (the same
      //     modulo-reshuffle every weight-sum change in this pipeline can
      //     cause -- not an independent defect).
      //   - `annualReviewPreset` (`journal`): slide index 1 (chapter,
      //     auto-picked) -- `banner-chapter` -> `rail-chapter`, the same
      //     total-weight-shift mechanism as above (journal's declared
      //     `masthead-chapter` weight bump moves the chapter pool's total
      //     from 12 to 14 -- same correction as above, the strategy layer's
      //     own weight-3 members are part of the base).
      // `.audit.json` needed no recapture for any of the three (findings
      // stayed the empty array both sides, confirmed by computing
      // `auditDeck` fresh against both the old and new goldens) -- the

      // Re-recaptured again (content-layout expansion wave, task T1 --

      // themes (`consulting`/`journal`) as every prior pool-growth
      // recapture -- same "real, intended selection-behavior change"
      // posture, not a migration regression. All three fixtures moved this
      // time (a first -- every prior pool-growth recapture above spared at
      // least one of the three):

      //     (content, auto-picked) -- `stacked-poster` -> `split-band`.
      //     `split-band` itself *is* the actual landed pick here, the
      //     first of these three fixtures where the newly-registered
      //     layout is the seed's real choice, not just a denominator
      //     reshuffle onto an existing one.
      //   - `scenarioBearing`: slide index 1 (content, auto-picked) --
      //     `bento-panel` -> `narrow-column`; slide index 2 (content,
      //     auto-picked) -- `narrow-column` -> `side-highlight`.
      //     `split-band` was never this fixture's landed pick -- pure
      //     denominator reshuffle onto existing layouts, same
      //     mechanism as every prior pool-growth recapture.
      //   - `annualReviewPreset`: slide indices 2 and 3 (content,
      //     auto-picked) -- `quiet-frame` -> `image-lead-split`,
      //     `stacked-poster` -> `asymmetric-triptych`. `split-band` was
      //     never this fixture's landed pick either.
      //
      // Unlike every prior pool-growth recapture, `.audit.json` *did* need
      // recapturing for one of the three: `annualReviewPreset`'s
      // re-landed `image-lead-split` page has 3 `kpi_cards` items sharing
      // its 435px text column (a pre-existing, review-approved T1
      // behavior, not something this task touches), and one card's
      // "average order value" label now truncates to "average …" at that
      // column's narrower per-card width -- a real `content-truncated`
      // finding, not a migration artifact. `basic`/`scenarioBearing`'s own
      // `.audit.json` needed no *content* recapture (`findings: []` both
      // sides, before and after -- only JSON pretty-printing whitespace
      // differs, an artifact of the recapture script's own
      // `JSON.stringify(..., null, 2)` versus whatever formatting produced
      // the pre-existing golden, not a behavior change). Verified via the
      // same targeted-diff discipline as every recapture above: the one
      // `content-truncated` finding is the *only* change anywhere in
      // `annualReviewPreset.audit.json` (`findings: []` -> one
      // `content-truncated` entry, `pagesAudited`/`pagesSkipped`/`checks`
      // all unchanged), and `content-truncated` is the pool's own
      // established "graceful degradation, not a rendering bug" signal
      // (`ir-quality`/`deck-audit.ts`'s documented distinction from
      // `overflow`/`out-of-bounds`/`overlap` -- the same three codes
      // `content-split-band.test.tsx`'s own pathological-content sweep
      // asserts zero of, deliberately excluding this one) -- there is
      // nothing to fix in the renderer here, this is the labeling
      // convention working as designed on a slide shape T1's own review
      // already accepted.
      //
      // Re-recaptured again (controller-probed follow-up fix round —
      // `content-image-lead-split.tsx`'s "starved" branch): the
      // `content-truncated` finding pinned directly above turned out to be
      // a real structural defect after all, not just an accepted labeling
      // convention — `image-lead-split`'s unconditional 435px text column
      // squeezed this exact kpi_cards-only page for no reason, since it has
      // no scalable (image/chart) lead component to justify narrowing
      // beside a real visual column. The layout now widens the text
      // column to 788px (and shrinks the decorative visual column to a
      // 260px accent panel) whenever there is no scalable lead — see that
      // file's own header for the full rationale and the skeleton-diversity
      // check that the widened width doesn't collide with an existing
      // layout's own region class. Only `annualReviewPreset`'s slide
      // index 2 is affected across all three fixtures (the only slide, in
      // any of them, that actually lands on `image-lead-split` with no
      // scalable lead — confirmed by diffing all 5 slides of each fixture's
      // recaptured SVG golden against its pre-recapture version, only this
      // one changed anywhere). `.audit.json`'s one `content-truncated`
      // finding goes back to `findings: []` (the label no longer truncates
      // at the widened per-card width); `.pptx-zip.json`'s file-name set is
      // unchanged, only that same slide's XML differs.
      //
      // Re-recaptured again (declaration-rebalance wave —
      // `.issues/2026-08-03-declaration-rebalance/plan.md`): consulting's
      // cover/ending and journal's chapter/ending each gained a second
      // `layoutTendencies` id (`../themes/definitions.ts`'s `LAYOUTS`
      // table) to fix the two axes each theme had silently dead under the
      // default `briefing` strategy — a real, intended selection-behavior
      // change (the whole point of the wave), not a migration regression.
      // Same "reweighting a pool a fixed seed's hash lands in can flip an
      // auto-pick" posture as every weight-table recapture above. Exactly
      // one slide changed in two of the three fixtures, the third
      // untouched (confirmed by diffing all 5 slides of each fixture's
      // recaptured SVG golden against its pre-recapture version):
      //   - `basic` (`consulting`): slide index 0 (cover, auto-picked) —
      //     `constellation` -> `banner-title`. Not `left-anchor` itself
      //     (the newly-appended id) — a mechanical side effect of the same
      //     append: bumping `left-anchor`'s weight 1 -> 3 grows the cover
      //     pool's total weight from 12 to 14, which shifts where this
      //     fixed seed's `target = hash % total` lands among the *other*
      //     candidates' boundaries too (the same modulo-reshuffle
      //     mechanism the theme-structure wave's own T2 recapture comment
      //     above already documents for `scenarioBearing`/
      //     `annualReviewPreset`).
      //   - `scenarioBearing` (`journal`): no change — this fixture's own
      //     cover/chapter/ending seeds don't happen to cross any of the
      //     three axes' new weight boundaries.
      //   - `annualReviewPreset` (`journal`): slide index 1 (chapter,
      //     auto-picked) — `rail-chapter` -> `tone-adaptive-chapter`. This
      //     *is* one of the two ids appended to journal's own `chapter`
      //     tendency (`["masthead-chapter", "roman-chapter",
      //     "tone-adaptive-chapter"]`) landing directly, not a reshuffle
      //     onto an unrelated existing layout.
      // `.audit.json` needed no recapture for any of the three (findings
      // stayed byte-identical, confirmed by computing `auditDeck` fresh
      // against both the old and new goldens) — neither newly-landed
      // layout introduces a new geometry/contrast finding on either
      // fixture. `.pptx-zip.json`'s file-name set is unchanged for all
      // three; only `basic`'s `ppt/slides/slide1.xml` and
      // `annualReviewPreset`'s `ppt/slides/slide2.xml` (1-indexed,
      // matching SVG slide 0 / slide 1 above) differ.
      // Recaptured (visual review round 1, 2026-08-15): `quote.tsx`'s
      // decorative open-quote mark used to reserve its own *baseline* plus a
      // gap above the first body line (`QUOTE_ZONE` 60 against a mark
      // baseline of 44), but a quotation glyph carries its ink high in the
      // em box, so the mark floated far above the text it opens — flagged on
      // every quote page the review saw. `QUOTE_ZONE` is now sized off the
      // mark's ink (34, baseline 40).
      // `scenarioBearing` and `annualReviewPreset` each carry one quote
      // slide, so each has exactly one changed slide (SVG slide 1 / slide 3;
      // PPTX `slide2.xml` / `slide4.xml`, 1-indexed). Targeted diff against
      // the pre-recapture goldens, same discipline as every recapture above:
      // the *only* changes anywhere in either fixture are that mark's
      // `y` 44 → 40, the body/attribution baselines moving up 26px with
      // `QUOTE_ZONE`, and the enclosing block's own `y` shifting by the
