/**
 * Domain-file contract types (src domain reorg wave 2, spec §4.1 + the
 * controller ruling amending it): the shape a future `src/ir/components/
 * <name>.ts` file (one per component, added in W2b/W2c — this task adds only
 * the types, migrates zero components) is expected to satisfy via three
 * named exports — uniformly `schema`, `aliases`, `traits` in every domain
 * file (not a type-suffixed or component-prefixed name; the aggregator is
 * what disambiguates, importing each with a per-component alias: `import {
 * schema as sankeySchema, aliases as sankeyAliases, traits as sankeyTraits }
 * from "./components/sankey"`).
 *
 * `IrComponentDomain` itself is a documentation/aggregation type, not
 * something a domain file imports and implements directly (TS has no
 * "this module's named exports satisfy this interface" construct) — three
 * separate top-level `export const`s can't literally `satisfies` one object
 * type. Its real consumers are (a) this doc comment / the domain-file
 * authoring convention it records, and (b) `src/ir/index.ts`'s future
 * aggregator (W2c), which re-assembles each domain file's three imports into
 * a value of this exact shape before folding it into the `discriminatedUnion`
 * / alias tables / traits registry — see each field's own doc comment below
 * for precisely which existing aggregate it feeds.

/**
 * One component's field-alias declaration (spec §4.1's `sankeyAliases`
 * example, generalized to the uniform `aliases` export name) — the
 * per-component slice of what `src/ir/field-aliases.ts` today stores as two
 * tables keyed *by* component type (`COMPONENT_FIELD_ALIASES`,
 * `COMPONENT_ITEM_FIELD_ALIASES`). A domain file needs no key (the file
 * *is* the one component), so this is just the row shape those two tables'
 * values already have, reusing `field-aliases.ts`'s own
 * {@link FieldAliasMap}/{@link ItemFieldAliasSpec} rather than redeclaring an
 * equivalent shape that could drift from it.

 * `PASSTHROUGH_SHELL_TYPES`/`FULL_BODY_TYPES`/`COLUMN_SPANNING_TYPES`),
 * plus `evidence` — spec
 * §4.1's named exception for `EVIDENCE_TYPES`: that collection carries
 * cross-component *priority order* (which type wins when more than one
 * appears), which is comparative knowledge no single component can declare
 * about itself, so it stays a hand-written ordered tuple in the aggregator
 * (component-traits.ts, unchanged by this task). A domain file declares only
 * the boolean "am I evidence-eligible at all" — the aggregator asserts the
 * set of components declaring `evidence: true` equals the set named in that
 * hand-written order (two independent sources of truth, drift between them
 * fails a test, per spec §4.1's own closing sentence).
 *
 * Field-for-field identical to the axes documented in
 * `src/render/component-traits.ts`'s own module doc comment — this interface
 * doesn't redefine their semantics, only gives the per-component boolean
 * declaration a name once domain files start producing them (W2b/W2c). Kept
 * here (ir side) rather than in `component-traits.ts` (svg side) because the
 * *declaration* is an ir-domain-file concern (spec §4.3: ir declares,
 * `component-traits.ts` reconstructs the sets from ir's declarations,
 * svg→ir being an already-existing dependency direction) — this task adds
 * only the type, `component-traits.ts`'s own sets are untouched.
