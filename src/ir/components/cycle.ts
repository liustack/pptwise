// cycle component wave (`.issues/2026-08-05-component-waves/plan-cycle.md`,
// 控制器裁定 1-4): closes the probe evidence gate's "closed-loop process"
// finding (2/2 — p02's 4-stage English process, 4/4 DEGRADED; p10's 5-stage
// Chinese ESG lifecycle reproduced the same failure on dsPro). Forced to
// draw a process that loops back to its own start, `flowchart` either
// paints the closing back-edge as a long stray line/arc crossing the whole
// diagram (a generic layered graph treats a closing back-edge as a stray
// line to route, with no notion that this one is special), or the model
// gives up on structure entirely and
// falls back to `steps` (no back-edge capability at all) plus a sentence
// doing the structural work in prose instead of the picture ("this cycle
// continues, re-design loops back to design"). `cycle` closes that gap by
// making the closed loop the geometry itself — a ring, not a graph layout
// that happens to have one more edge than usual.
//
// 裁定 1 — minimal semantic surface: no `direction` field (always clockwise
// — no probe evidence names a counter-clockwise reading), no center-text
// slot (more placeholders crowd an already-tight ring; deferred pending
// real evidence), no per-item icon.
