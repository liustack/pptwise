// could mis-order" concern doesn't apply here — a node's identity is its own
// `id`, referenced by `links[].from`/`to`, not by array position), so this
// stays the natural {nodes[], links[]} shape rather than forcing named slots
// where none would make sense.

/**
 * Classic 3-color DFS cycle detection, returning one concrete node-id path
 * (e.g. `["a","b","c","a"]`) rather than just "a cycle exists somewhere" —
 * actionable for a weak model to repair by naming exactly which link to
 * remove or redirect (plan task 3 item 1: "带可执行消息"). Iterates
 * `nodeIds`/each node's outgoing adjacency list in *authored array order*
 * (both built from `c.nodes`/`c.links` by the caller, never a Map/Set
 * iteration for anything order-sensitive), so the specific cycle reported is
 * deterministic across runs even when a graph contains more than one.
 *
 * Written as a return-threading recursive helper — not a closure mutating an
 * outer `let` — deliberately: an earlier version threaded a shared `let
 * cyclePath` through the recursive `visit` closure instead, which TS's
 * control-flow narrowing couldn't follow across the closure boundary
 * (`cyclePath` narrowed to `never` at the read site despite the runtime
 * value being correct) — functional return-threading sidesteps that
 * whole class of narrowing fragility rather than fighting it with a type
 * assertion.
