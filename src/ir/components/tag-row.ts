// tag_row component wave (`.issues/2026-08-06-tag-row/plan.md`, 控制器裁定
// 1-3): the 38th component. Closes the internal invented-name gap Cluster C
// (`.issues/2026-08-06-layout-component-research/internal.md` §2.2) — a
// small-label row the pool had no first-class home for, so weak models kept
// inventing one by name:
//
//  - deepseek-agentic q17 ("H2 Engineering Planning Review", a real deck)
//    burned one whole slide brute-forcing 76 component names, `tag`/`pill`/
//    `chip_row`/`label` among them, every one hard-failing `"tag" is not a
//    valid component type` (`results-archive/2026-08-05-round2/
//    deepseek-agentic/report.md`).
//  - the same names recur in the p14 supplier-due-diligence probe workspace
//    (`results-probe/deepseek-agentic/p14/workspace/probe6.json`:
//    `tag`/`tags`/`chip`/`chips`/`pill`/`pills`/`tag_cloud`).
//
// Named after the models' own most-guessed name (裁定: 采模型呼声最高者):
// across the bench+probe archive the exact-string tally is `tag` ×3
// instances / 2 runs and `pill` ×3 / 2 runs (tied highest), then `chips`
// ×2/2, `badge` ×2/2, `chip_row` ×2/1. `pill` is a shape word (a capsule),
// `tag` is the semantic concept the shape carries, so the tie breaks to
// `tag`; the models attested the container suffix `_row` themselves
// (`chip_row` ×2), so `tag_row` = winning semantic root + model-attested
// container word, matching the house `<item>_<row/cards>` convention
// (`row_cards`/`icon_cards`).
//
// 裁定 1 — minimal semantic surface: `items` is a plain array of short
// strings (a tag is a label, not a struct — no per-tag icon, color, or
// link: chartPalette rotation is deliberately NOT used here, 裁定 2, unlike
// people_cards' badges — the two-tier surface/accent fill below carries all
// the emphasis this component needs). An optional overall `title`, and an
// optional `emphasis: "none" | "first"` (image_grid's own field/semantics —
// highlight the first tag as the primary one among secondaries).
