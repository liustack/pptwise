// people_cards component wave (`.issues/2026-08-05-component-waves/
// plan-people-cards.md`, 控制器裁定 1-4): closes the probe evidence gate's
// "people roster" finding (2/2). p05's 5-exec-intro first case named only
// a missing initials-avatar axis — every other field (name/title/
// background/remit) already survived on `row_cards`/`icon_cards`, a
// narrow case easy to misread as "just add an icon". p12's second case is
// the harder, machine-checkable one: a 9-speaker conference lineup blows
// straight through both siblings' schema-level `.max(6)` — the only
// single-shot model call that actually returned valid IR split the roster
// into two unlabeled "(1/2)"/"(2/2)" pages with no semantic grouping
// behind the split (the other three timed out/rate-limited on the longer
// prompt, never producing IR at all). `people_cards` closes both gaps at
// once: a dedicated initials-badge identity axis, and enough headroom
// (12) to hold p12's 9 speakers on one page with margin to spare.
//
// 裁定 1 — minimal semantic surface: `name` is the only required field on
// each person; `role`/`org` stay optional. No photo field — a slide with
// real headshots already has `image_grid`, and photo licensing is the
// author's own problem, not something this schema should speculate a slot
// for. No contact/social-link fields either — no probe evidence names
// either one; this component's entire differentiator is the zero-asset
// initials badge, not a contact card.
