/**
 * Three representative v3 decks for the vocabulary-v4 rename's equivalence
 * proof (task 1, spec §9.1/§10/§12): a plain deck with no `scenario` at all
 * (defaults chain), a deck with an explicit `scenario` axes object using the
 * pre-rename mode/delivery *values* this task renames (`mode: "narrative"`,
 * `delivery: "text"` — exercises both the mode-value and delivery-value
 * remap in one fixture), and a deck using the `annual-review` named preset
 * (spec §5's own worked example: `mode: narrative` → `strategy:
 * storytelling` inside that preset's definition).
 *
 * Shared by two things that must stay in lockstep:
 *  - the base-commit capture script (task-1 report) that rendered these
 *    exact objects with the pre-rename code and saved the output as this
 *    task's golden fixtures (`equivalence-golden/*.json`, committed
 *    alongside this file)
 *  - `../migrate-equivalence.test.ts`, which replays the same objects
 *    through `PptxIRV3Schema` → `migrateIrV3ToV4` → the (now v4-only) render
 *    chain and asserts byte-equality against that golden output
 *
 * Deliberately untyped (`Record<string, unknown>`, not `PptxIRV3`): every
 * field here is deliberately written in raw v3 vocabulary (`scenario`, not
 * `narrative`) so a plain object literal reads correctly regardless of which
 * IR version's types are in scope when this file is imported.
