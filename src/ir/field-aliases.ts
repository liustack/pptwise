/**
 * Deterministic field-alias normalization — a rescue layer for weak-model
 * synonym field-name drift (a model writing kpi `title` when the schema
 * wants `label`, quote `content` when it wants `text`, and so on). Ported
 * from ops-kb's `field_aliases.py` (`_BLOCK_FIELD_ALIASES` /
 * `_ITEM_FIELD_ALIASES`, the production system pptwise was extracted from):
 * a 2026-07-12 failure-sample bucketing there found ~90% of weak-model
 * `fill` failures were exactly this shape — a pair of "unrecognized field"
 * + "field required" errors for a synonym pair (kpi `title`→`label` alone
 * was 13 of that day's failures) that salvage-style extra-key stripping
 * cannot fix, because stripping the wrong-named key still leaves the
 * canonical one missing. The table must be *carried*, not dropped.
 *
 * Every ops-kb table entry was cross-checked against this repo's own
 * `ComponentSchema` (`./index.ts`): the port needed zero drops — every
 * ops-kb target field still exists post block→component rename (see the W5
 * task-4 report for the row-by-row check). Two deliberate departures from
 * the ops-kb original, both driven by this repo's own "omission gets a
 * default, a wrong value is a hard error" posture (not ops-kb's — a
 * same-thread retry-avoidance system with different incentives):
 *  - both canonical and alias present here → left untouched (ops-kb instead
 *    always discards the alias and keeps the canonical value); zod strict
 *    then reports the leftover alias key as unrecognized. Two conflicting
 *    keys is a wrong value, not an omission — it should hard-block, not
 *    silently resolve in the canonical key's favor.
 *  - no value coercion (ops-kb's `_coerce_str`, an int/float→string rescue
 *    for a pattern like timeline `year: 2024`) — out of scope for a table
 *    that normalizes field *names*; a type mismatch surviving a correct
 *    rename is still a legitimate zod error, not a naming problem.
 *
 * **`COMPONENT_FIELD_ALIASES`/`COMPONENT_ITEM_FIELD_ALIASES` are pure
 * aggregators (src domain reorg wave 2, spec §4.3), same discipline as
 * `src/svg/layouts/registry.ts`'s T1d precedent.** Every row used to be a
 * hand-copied literal directly inside one of these two tables. Each
 * component's own alias rows now live beside its IR schema instead — the
 * `aliases: ComponentAliasSpec` export at the bottom of the matching
 * `src/ir/components/<name>.ts` domain file (spec §4.1) — imported below and
 * referenced by `.block`/`.items`, under the exact same table key the
 * literal used to occupy. A component with no alias rows still exports
 * `aliases = {}`; this file's tables simply don't reference it (`bullets`,
 * `chart`, … have no row in either table, same as before this wave). Every
 * other export in this file — `FieldAliasMap`/`ItemFieldAliasSpec` (the
 * shapes a domain file's own `aliases` export is checked against),
 * `SLIDE_FIELD_ALIASES` (slide-level, out of the component-domain split's
 * scope — the singular `notes` synonym rescue was never a per-component
 * concern), and every function below (`normalizeComponentAliases` and its
 * private helpers) — is machinery that *applies* the two tables, not table
 * content itself, and is unchanged by this wave.
