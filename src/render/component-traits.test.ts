// plans to reverse-generate one `traits: ComponentTraits` declaration per
// `src/ir/components/<name>.ts` domain file by reading these 6 collections
// (`ComponentTraits`'s own doc comment, `src/ir/components/types.ts`) — that
// is only sound if every member of every collection below is a real,
// current `COMPONENT_TYPES` entry. To be precise about what this test does
// and doesn't add: TypeScript's structural typing already catches a
// component renamed or removed in `ir/index.ts` without a matching
// `component-traits.ts` update *today* — each collection below is typed
// `ReadonlySet<ComponentType>` / `readonly ComponentType[]`
// (`ComponentType = Component["type"]`, `./component-traits.ts`'s own top
// doc comment), so a stale literal fails `tsc` loudly, typically cascading
// into many more errors across every file still referencing the old type
// string (review round for this task measured 144 cascading errors from a
// single rename) — not a silent gap `pnpm check` would miss. This test's
// real value is narrower: a fast, explicit, human-readable check that
// doesn't need a full compiler run, and — more importantly — a runtime
// backstop for W2c's planned traits reverse-generation, once these
// collections' ir-side successors (one `ComponentTraits` declaration per
// `src/ir/components/*.ts` domain file) are assembled by a codegen/
// aggregation step that reads them as plain data rather than as
// compile-time-checked literals the way today's 6 `Set`s are. The describe
// blocks above already pin every collection's exact membership against a
// hardcoded pre-refactor twin, but neither that nor the type system cross-
// checks against the *live* `COMPONENT_TYPES` export (`@/ir`, derived from
// `ComponentSchema.options`) — this adds that one specific cross-check
