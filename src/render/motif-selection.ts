/**
 * Motif candidate-set rotation (P1 variety wave, task 2 — spec/plan
 * `.issues/plans/2026-07-23-pptwise-p1-variety.md` 任务 2). Before this
 * task, `themeDef.motif` (`src/themes/definitions.ts`) was a single fixed id
 * per theme — every decor-bearing page in a deck's whole lifetime drew the
 * exact same sticker (C3 in the diversity deep-review: "全库唯二完全不吃
 * seed 的视觉元素" alongside chart palette, see `chart-palette.ts`). This
 * module replaces that single id with a per-theme *candidate set* (2-3
 * style-compatible motifs, one exception below) and a seed+pageKey weighted
 * pick — `weightedPickBySeed`, the exact mechanism `layout-selection.ts`
 * already uses for layout selection — so different decor pages in one deck
 * commonly land on different motifs while a single deck+seed stays fully
 * deterministic (double-render identical) and editing one page never
 * reshuffles another (pageKey-scoped, no cross-page fold — unlike layout
 * selection's adjacent anti-repetition, motif has no cross-page dependency
 * at all, so this is structurally simpler than `resolveLayoutId`).
 *
 * ## Candidate-set design (the content decision, argued per theme below)
 *
 * `MOTIF_CANDIDATES` is keyed by `CanonicalThemeId` and deliberately a
 * `Partial` — `runway`, `museum`, and `stage` have no entry at
 * all (not an empty array): those themes' `THEME_DEFINITIONS[id].motif` is
 * `undefined` by settled design. runway is typography-only ("排印至上",
 * tried with a motif twice and reverted both times). museum's corner pins
 * were struck (2026-08-21). stage is the undecorated black field
 * (2026-08-21, 无框黑场 — a frame of any weight would read as luxe /
 * museum's cousin).
 * block is decoration-for-decoration's-sake). There is nothing to rotate
 * for a theme with no motif to begin with.
 *
 * Every other candidate set's **first element is always that theme's own
 * pre-existing anchor motif** (`THEME_DEFINITIONS[id].motif`, locked by
 * `motif-selection.test.ts`) and carries {@link MOTIF_ANCHOR_WEIGHT} against
 * every other member's {@link MOTIF_BASE_WEIGHT} — the same 3:1 ratio
 * `layout-selection.ts`'s `TENDENCY_WEIGHT`/`BASE_WEIGHT` and
 * `BEAT_TENDENCY_WEIGHT`/`BEAT_BASE_WEIGHT` already use, reused rather than
 * inventing a fourth magic ratio. This keeps the theme's identity anchor the
 * *plurality* pick always (3 vs. 1 beats any single rival) and the outright
 * *majority* pick whenever the set has only 2 members (3:1 = 75%) — a real
 * deck should still read as "the theme it was built in" most of the time,
 * with the sibling(s) as a recognizable but clearly secondary variation.
 *
 * Candidates are grouped by decorative *technique family* — the actual
 * drawing vocabulary each motif's own source header documents (grid/line
 * geometry vs. gradient-field glow vs. thin ornamental line vs. organic
 * blob/wash vs. bold color-brush) — not by superficial theme category, so a
 * sibling never reads as a random reshuffle:
 *
 * | theme | candidates (anchor first) | rationale |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | consulting | gauge-motif *(singleton)* | 2026-08-25 量规重构锁定左上定位角标。旧 banner-motif 保留给现有借用方，consulting 不再参与该候选。 |
 * | insight | poster-motif *(singleton)* | board-cover-restore wave 2 (2026-08-22): locked to the cover-board motif so gallery p01 cannot draw constellation's sibling glow. Ruling: built-in theme decoration is locked. |
 * | academic | rail-motif *(singleton)* | board-cover-restore wave 2 (2026-08-22): locked to the cover-board motif so gallery p01 cannot draw banner or journal's masthead rules. Ruling: built-in theme decoration is locked. |
 * | tech | constellation-motif *(singleton)* | board-cover-restore wave 2 (2026-08-22): locked to the cover-board motif so gallery p01 cannot draw poster ticker or enterprise's grid. Ruling: built-in theme decoration is locked. |
 * | runway | *(none — settled decision, see module doc above)* | typography-only is the adjudicated look; no candidate set |
 * | museum | *(none — corner decor struck, 2026-08-21)* | identity in palette and serif type; no candidate set |
 * | stage | *(none — undecorated black field, 2026-08-21)* | 无框 is the identity; no candidate set |
 * | playbill | playbill-motif *(singleton)* | Motif is empty. Cover date chip is bill-head foreground (wave 7 geometry). Chapter / content / ending do not draw a chip. |
 * | journal | corner-ornament-motif *(singleton)* | board-cover-restore wave 2 (2026-08-22): locked to the cover-board motif (masthead rules + issue number) so gallery p01 cannot draw heritage's bookplate or rail. Ruling: built-in theme decoration is locked. |
 * | enterprise | enterprise-motif, banner-motif, rail-motif | enterprise's Swiss-grid IKB identity pairs only with the other minimal geometric-line motifs (banner's grid, rail's arc) — organic/wash/ornamental families would visibly clash with its industrial-design register |
 * | luxe | luxe-motif *(singleton)* | board-cover-restore wave 2 (2026-08-22): locked to the cover-board motif (gilt invitation frame) so gallery p01 cannot draw heritage florets or journal's masthead rules. Ruling: built-in theme decoration is locked. |
 * | campaign | campaign-motif *(singleton)* | campaign's saturated multi-hue crayon/brush vocabulary has no sibling anywhere in the other 12 motifs — pairing it with grid lines, watercolor wash, or gold hairlines would break its "活力营销" identity rather than vary it, so it is deliberately left alone (candidate set of 1 — same-deck renders stay byte-identical to before this task, see `motif-selection.test.ts`'s byte-inertness block) |
 * | classroom | classroom-motif *(singleton)* | one legal-pad vocabulary (top punch holes, a pencil dashed line, a paperclip arc). The watercolor sibling was deleted, so there is nothing left to rotate *between*. Chapter still draws nothing (`return null`) — classroom's chapter background is a full-bleed `primary` band and this motif's muted/accent inks measure 1.04-1.55:1 against it, which is invisible, not restrained. |
 * | ink | ink-motif *(singleton)* | ink's calligraphy/seal-stamp/vertical-inscription vocabulary is the most culturally-specific motif in the set with no sibling family — any other motif substituted in would read as a mismatched skin rather than a variation, so it stays a candidate set of 1 (byte-identical, same rationale pattern as campaign) |
 * | heritage | heritage-motif *(singleton)* | board-cover-restore wave 2 (2026-08-22): locked to the cover-board motif (bookplate rules + cover stamp) so gallery p01 cannot draw luxe's gilt frame. Ruling: built-in theme decoration is locked. |
 * | pulse | pulse-motif *(singleton)* | themes-16 wave, task T1 (2026-07-28): pulse's thin ECG pulse-line + capsule/cell-dot vocabulary is its own new technique family with no sibling among the other 13 motifs (not organic-blob like classroom, not thin-ornamental-line like journal/heritage/luxe, not grid-geometry like consulting/enterprise) — pairing it with any existing motif would read as a mismatched skin rather than a variation, so it stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as campaign/ink) |
 * | terra | terra-motif *(singleton)* | themes-16 wave, task T2 (2026-07-28): terra's topographic contour-line + leaf-vein/seed-dot vocabulary is its own new technique family — closer to classroom's organic register than to any grid or ornamental-line family, but its lines are irregular *closed terrain rings* (a land/growth reading), not smooth color blobs or watercolor wash, so pairing it with classroom would still read as a mismatched skin. Stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as pulse/campaign/ink) |
 * | ember | ember-motif *(singleton)* | themes-16 wave, task T3 (2026-07-28): ember's rising-spark-particle vocabulary (dots fading along an ascending bezier arc) is its own new technique family — a directional motion mark, not a static blob/ornament/grid/glow like any of the other 15 motifs, so no existing motif reads as a compatible sibling. Stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as pulse/terra/campaign/ink) |
 * | vermilion | vermilion-motif *(singleton)* | gov-theme wave (2026-08-06): vermilion's flag-ribbon-arc + gold-ray-fan vocabulary is its own new technique family — a filled tapering ribbon along an ascending bezier plus a radiating thin-line ray fan, reading as ceremonial "提气/庄重" official-report identity. Not a static blob/ornament, not a grid/glow, not ember's fading particle trail — no existing motif reads as a compatible sibling, and its deliberately-restrained CJK-official register would clash with any of the other 16. Stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as pulse/terra/ember/campaign/ink) |
 * | crayon | crayonbox-motif *(singleton)* | 2026-08-25 一盒蜡笔重构锁定右上角阳光黄太阳与星贴纸。旧 crayon-motif 保持注册并保留回归测试，不改其实现。 |
 * | arena | arena-motif *(singleton)* | 2026-08-21: arena's HUD-bracket + speed-line vocabulary is its own new technique family — corner brackets, 45° edge streaks, a segmented energy bar. Campaign's confetti and tech's constellation chain are the nearest neighbours by scene, not by mark, so pairing either in would read as a mismatched skin rather than a variation. Stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as campaign/ink/pulse/terra/ember/vermilion) |
 * | lecture | lecture-motif *(singleton)* | 2026-08-21: lecture's 26px-inset 1px chalk-tray frame is its own new technique family — a single dark groove, not luxe's double gilt invitation frame, not ink's colophon-and-seal rail. Pairing either in would read as a mismatched skin rather than a variation. Stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as campaign/ink/pulse/terra/ember/vermilion/crayon/arena). |
 * | swiss | swiss-motif *(singleton)* | 2026-08-21 wave7: swiss's 12px top edge bar + three right-margin ticks is its own new technique family — a page-edge stamp, not vermilion's gold-rule file header, not enterprise's IKB square steps, not tech's constellation chain. Pairing any of those in would read as a mismatched skin rather than a variation. Stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as campaign/ink/pulse/terra/ember/vermilion/crayon/arena) |
 * | memo | memo-motif *(singleton)* | 2026-08-21: memo's typewriter double-rule + MEMORANDUM eyebrow is its own new technique family — stamp-red lines and a Latin mono decorative word, never a fill. Journal's masthead rules and heritage's bookplate rules sit in the same printed-line neighbourhood, but both already rotate with each other and with luxe; pairing either in would collapse memo into the editorial-print cluster it was designed to leave. Stays a candidate set of 1 (same rationale pattern as vermilion/ink). |
 *
 * `tone-adaptive-motif` — the 13th registered motif — is
 * deliberately absent from every candidate set above: its own source header
 * describes it as an almost-invisible full-page tint used as a
 * theme-agnostic *fallback* texture, not a themed decorative mark. Adding it
 * anywhere would reduce a page's visible motif to "nothing" some fraction of
 * the time, which is the opposite of this task's goal (make cross-page
 * decor variety a visible, positive signal, not a coin flip toward blank).
 *
 * ## Contrast safety
 *
 * Two independent nets, checking two different things — neither one alone
 * is the whole story, and conflating them was this task's own review-round
 * Major/Moderate mistake (below):
 *
 * 1. **Does a candidate motif make *other* page text unreadable?**
 *    `motif-candidate-contrast.test.ts`'s first sweep runs the existing
 *    `findContrastIssues`/`auditDeck` machinery against every candidate —
 *    but that machinery only ever grades *text*, and a motif's arc/grid/
 *    stroke is not text. So this sweep can prove decor never breaks *other*
 *    text — it structurally cannot prove decor is itself visible against its
 *    own background. (Which decor *shapes* count as a background for other
 *    text is a separate question, and no longer a blanket exclusion:
 *    `fix/decor-contrast-attribution` admits a decor `rect`/`circle`/
 *    `ellipse` whose registered geometry is its painted outline, and keeps
 *    `path`/`polygon` out — see `findContrastIssues`'s own doc comment.)
 * 2. **Does a candidate motif's own decor render invisibly against its own
 *    background?** A distinct question, added by `motif-candidate-contrast
 *    .test.ts`'s second sweep (review fix round, Moderate finding). The
 *    worked example below is now history rather than live code — the
 *    editorial-group reskin (2026-08-20) retired `banner-motif`'s chapter
 *    branch outright (it draws nothing on chapter now, because two of its
 *    three consumer themes paint their chapter ground in the very token the
 *    rules are drawn with, measuring 1.00:1) — but the defect class it
 *    describes is exactly why that measurement gets taken. Every
 *    motif's own "零 hex 纪律" (zero baked hex, colors read off `ctx`) means
 *    a shared token like `ctx.colors.primary`/`border` naturally adapts to
 *    whichever theme is rendering — but `banner-motif`/`rail-motif`'s
 *    chapter branches used to be a **documented exception** to that
 *    discipline: a literal `"#FFFFFF"`, tuned only for their own anchor
 *    theme's dark chapter background (`consulting`/`academic`). Once this
 *    task made those two motifs *candidates* for other themes too
 *    (`enterprise`, chapter bg `#FFFFFF`; `journal`, chapter bg `#FAF7F2`),
 *    the literal became invisible white-on-(near-)white — a real defect
 *    sweep 1 above could never have caught (its own `<g data-decor>`
 *    exclusion), caught instead by a human reviewer and now fixed:
 *    both branches derive their ink from `readableOn(ctx.defaultBg ??
 *    ctx.colors.bg)` (`../ink.ts`) instead of a hard-coded literal — see
 *    each source file's own doc comment for the byte-identity proof that
 *    their own anchor theme's render is unchanged. Chart-palette rotation's
 *    own separate leak into this same "shared `ctx` token" hazard (`ctx
 *    .colors.chartPalette` briefly rotated in place, silently repainting
 *    `campaign-motif`/`classroom-motif`'s *unrelated*
 *    decorative reads of that token) is `../chart-palette.ts`'s own
 *    "Consumption seam" section, not repeated here.
 *
 * `motif-candidate-contrast.test.ts`'s second sweep is the durable
 * regression net for defect class 2 — every candidate's own decor must clear
 * a small but nonzero visibility floor against its real background,
 * wherever it renders anything at all (`classroom-motif` `return null`s on
 * `chapter` entirely, pre-dating this task — see the `classroom`
 * table row's own disclosure — correctly not flagged by either sweep:
 * nothing rendered is not the same failure as something rendered
 * invisibly). No candidate needed removal from this table — every
 * fix landed at the motif's own consumption seam instead. Recorded here per
 * 控制者裁决 §4's re-pin discipline, so a future reviewer doesn't have to
 * re-derive "was this checked, and for which defect class" from git blame.
