/**
 * Component trait registry (W2 task 5, spec §3/§6/§8 — re-derived as a pure
 * aggregator in src domain reorg wave 2, spec §4.3). Single home for the
 * render-time layout/degrade machinery's component classifications
 * `ReadonlySet`s (`STRETCHABLE_TYPES`/`SELF_VISUAL_TYPES`/`SCALABLE_TYPES`/
 * `PASSTHROUGH_SHELL_TYPES`/`FULL_BODY_TYPES`/`COLUMN_SPANNING_TYPES`) plus the ordered
 * `EVIDENCE_TYPES` tuple.
 *
 * **Aggregator, not author (src domain reorg wave 2).** Every component's
 * boolean trait flags used to live here as a hand-written literal Set
 * membership (W2 task 5's own unification of 5 previously-scattered
 * definitions). They now live beside each component's own IR schema instead —
 * a `traits: ComponentTraits` export at the bottom of the matching
 * `src/ir/components/<name>.ts` domain file (`ComponentTraits`'s own doc
 * comment there is the authority on what each trait means) — so
 * "take one component away whole" carries its render-time classification with
 * it instead of leaving a trailing edit in a sixth file. This file's own job
 * is now purely computational: import every domain file's `traits`, pair each
 * with its own `type` literal in `ALL_TRAITS` below, and derive the Sets by
 * filtering on the matching boolean — never a re-export relay, never a
 * hand-maintained literal member list. Exported names and `Set` semantics are
 * unchanged from W2 task 5 (every consumer of `STRETCHABLE_TYPES` etc. reads
 * this file exactly as before); only *how* each Set's membership is produced
 * moved, same as T1d's `layouts/registry.ts` precedent for layout
 * `layoutDef`s.
 *
 * `EVIDENCE_TYPES` is the one export this aggregator does not derive
 * mechanically (spec §4.1's named exception, see its own doc comment below)
 * — it carries cross-component *priority order*, comparative knowledge no
 * single domain file can declare about itself, so it stays a hand-written
 * ordered tuple here. `component-traits.test.ts` pins the consistency
 * invariant between this hand-written order and the domain files' own
 * `evidence: true` declarations (two independent sources of truth, drift
 * between them fails a test — spec §4.1's own closing sentence).
 *
 * This registry is still the *dynamic/render-time* half of the inventory's
 * "容量双系统" (2026-07-18 decision #5): it still runs on every render to
 * decide stretch/self-visual/scalable/passthrough-shell/evidence-priority
 * behavior — nothing here is new metadata. The *static/authoring-time* half —
 * `layouts/registry.ts`'s slot `capacity` numbers and `audit/capacity.ts`'s
 * `CAPACITY` table — is a separate, declarative concern; this file has no
 * capacity numbers in it.
 *
 * Not merged into one tagged enum: each set classifies a different
 * *behavior axis*, not the same axis at different thresholds — a component
 * can be simultaneously stretchable (layout.ts's density-fill) and
 * evidence-priority-ranked (AssertionEvidence's dispatch), so collapsing
 * them would force every consumer to reason about axes it doesn't care
 * about. `ComponentTraits` (the per-component declaration shape, `src/ir/
 * components/types.ts`) mirrors this same "independent axes, not one enum"
 * posture at the declaration site. `columnSpanning` is opt-in. Its absence
 * means false, avoiding mechanical churn in ordinary column components.
 */

/** The IR's component discriminant union (`ComponentSchema`'s `type`
