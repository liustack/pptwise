/**
 * Build an image-generation brief for every `image` component in a deck: the

 * frame), the resolved theme's palette/mood, and a paste-ready English
 * `suggested_prompt`. Pure function of `ir` (same input → same output, proven
 * by `asset-brief.test.ts`'s double-call check) — like `auditDeck`, it never
 * mutates its argument and never touches the filesystem or network.
 *
 * v1 scope (asset-brief plan 裁定 4): only `image`-typed components — not
 * `image_grid`/`image_compare` (separate component types with their own
 * asset_id arrays), and not `background` asset specs. Both are natural v2
 * extensions of this same shape and are deliberately left off `AssetBrief`
 * rather than bolted on half-done.
 *
 * Missing-asset handling (裁定 2): every `image` component's `asset_id`,
 * present or not, gets overridden to the same dummy 1×1 PNG (tagged with a
 * `#<asset_id>` fragment) in an in-memory copy of `ir` used *only* for this
 * function's own extraction render pass — `ir` itself, and the real render/
 * export path, never see this override. `missing` below is decided from the
 * real `ir.assets.images` (before the override), so it still accurately
 * reports "nothing usable was ever supplied here" even though the
 * extraction render always has *something* to draw. Overriding every
 * asset_id uniformly (not just the missing ones) is what makes the fragment
 * a reliable identifier regardless of whether the real asset was already
 * resolved — the alternative (leaving resolved assets' real `src` alone)
 * would have no way to tell two different real images' hrefs apart when a
 * page has more than one.
 *
 * Known limitation: an `asset_id` shared between an `image` component and a
 * `background` asset spec on the same page would get the same dummy
 * fragment on both, which could ambiguate which rendered `<image>` this
 * function attributes to the component — rare in practice (v1 doesn't cover
 * background geometry at all, see above) and left as a documented gap
 * rather than engineered around.
 *
 * Shared-`asset_id` handling (task reviewer finding, fixed after v1's first
 * pass): the IR schema places no uniqueness constraint on `asset_id`
 * (`src/ir/index.ts`) — two different `image` components on the same page
 * legally reference the same one. Because the override above (deliberately)
 * maps a shared `asset_id` to one shared dummy href, both occurrences render
 * an *identical* `<image href>` — the rendered SVG carries no signal left to
 * tell them apart. (v1's first pass tried anyway: a FIFO queue keyed by
 * `asset_id`, drained in `slide.components` order under the assumption that
 * extraction order would match — it doesn't in general, e.g.
 * `content-image-lead-split.tsx` renders its narrow-column body *before*
 * its visual-lead column in the JSX it returns, so the queue was backwards
 * and every frame ended up attributed to the wrong occurrence. Not a fixable
 * ordering bug: no ordering convention could be relied on across every
 * layout's own JSX emission order, present and future.) The honest fix:
 * per page, group `image` components by `asset_id` first. A group of size 1
 * (the overwhelmingly common case) keeps the exact single-item shape this
 * function always produced. A group of size >1 abandons per-component
 * attribution entirely — it emits one item per *real rendered frame* for
 * that `asset_id` (not per component), each flagged `shared: true` with the
 * group's `occurrenceCount`, so every real frame is still reported (nothing
 * silently dropped) without asserting a specific component<->frame pairing
 * that cannot be known. If fewer frames render than there are occurrences
 * (e.g. the layout dropped one), the shortfall is padded with `rendered:
 * false` shared items so the count of components sharing the id is still
 * fully visible to a reader of the brief.
