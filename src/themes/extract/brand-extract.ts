/**
 * Local brand-color/font extraction from a user's own `.thmx`/`.potx`/`.pptx`
 * OOXML theme part (brand-extract wave, roadmap §2.0.1: the free
 * adoption-friction remover — "the output doesn't look like our company" is
 * pptwise's #1 enterprise-adoption blocker, and every user who hits it
 * already has a company template on disk). Everything in this module runs
 * against zip bytes only (`jszip`, already a browser-safe dependency) —
 * `src/index.ts`'s dependency closure stays free of Node-only deps
 * (`AGENTS.md`'s layout rule), so this can run in a browser as readily as
 * the CLI's `pptwise brand extract` wraps it for.
 *
 * Rewritten from `.issues/notes/brand-extraction-probe.py` (the 39/39
 * feasibility reference: every macOS Office `.thmx` extracted cleanly) —
 * read that file for the reference regex shapes, not embedded here as
 * Python. This is a TS reimplementation, not a port with a Python shim.
 *
 * ── Slot → token mapping (roadmap §2.0.1's table, 裁定 2) ──────────────
 *
 *   dk1/lt1 (by measured lightness) → text / bg — see below, not a fixed
 *                      dk1→text/lt1→bg assignment
 *   lt2              → surface (falls back to bg when absent)
 *   accent1 (or dk2) → primary/accent
 *   accent1-6        → chartPalette (OOXML's 6 accent slots map 1:1 onto
 *                      pptwise's chart palette — no reshaping needed)
 *   —                → muted, derived (see {@link deriveMuted})
 *
 * ── bg/text assignment: by measured lightness, not slot name ────────────
 *
 * OOXML's `dk1`/`lt1` are slot *names*, not a guarantee about which one is
 * actually darker. Empirically verified against all 39 real `.thmx` files
 * shipped with a local macOS Office install (`.issues/notes/brand-extraction-probe.py`'s
 * own corpus) before writing this: every single one — including
 * "Dark Gradient.thmx", the one visually dark-background theme in that
 * set — declares the conventional `dk1=#000000`/`lt1=#FFFFFF` unchanged;
 * six declare a near-black-but-not-pure `dk1` (e.g. `#131313`), never a
 * *light* `dk1`. A theme's actual dark/light background comes from the
 * slide master's own background fill (`<p:bg>`, often referencing `dk2` or a
 * gradient) — a part this extractor deliberately never reads (theme part
 * only, 裁定 1) — not from which literal color sits in `dk1` vs `lt1`. So
 * this extractor makes no claim about detecting "is this a dark theme" at
 * all; it only guards against the (real, if rare outside this local corpus)
 * case of a producer that swapped which raw color occupies which *named*
 * slot: {@link resolveBgText} assigns `text` to whichever of `dk1`/`lt1`
 * measures darker and `bg` to whichever measures lighter, regardless of
 * which slot name it came from — always a legible dark-ink-on-light-bg (or,
 * for a genuinely inverted producer, the reverse) pairing, never a
 * name-literal assignment that could land dark-on-dark. `isDark` (below)
 * measures "darker" with nothing but the already-exported `contrastRatio`
 * (`../../render/ink`) against pure black/white — no new luminance formula, per
 * this wave's "reuse existing ratio/mix utilities" discipline.
