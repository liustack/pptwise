 * by `target = hash % totalWeight` — so a *fixed* seed lands on a different
 * candidate even though nothing about the existing 8 layouts changed. This is

 * previous pool growth in this repo did the same thing on its own axis (see
 * `migrate-equivalence.test.ts`'s recapture chain for image-lead-split /
 * split-band). It is the first one to hit the cover axis, and covers are the
 * page people look at, which is why it is written down here instead of

// All 18 combinations above pass clean on the three geometry codes this task

// same 18 fixtures during this task's own investigation surfaced three
// `low-contrast`/`content-truncated` findings outside that scope — recorded
// here rather than silently dropped, same "understood, not fixed" posture
// `deck-audit.test.ts`/`full-matrix-contrast.test.ts` already use for their
// own adjudicated exceptions:
//
// - `content-truncated` on several covers/endings (the pinned `MIXED_LONG`
//   subheading outgrows its one-line budget): this is the shrink-then-
//   truncate pipeline working as designed (`fitHeadingLines`/`fitSvgLine`'s
//   own floor-then-ellipsis contract) — the mechanism that keeps this exact
//   content class out of `overflow` in the first place, not a defect.
// - `low-contrast` on `consulting/banner-ending` (3.22:1) and
//   `academic/rail-ending` (2.93:1)'s copyright line, both against the
//   real `contact`/`copyright` meta this fixture populates: traced to each
//   layout's own `COPYRIGHT_FAINT` — a hardcoded, pre-existing decorative
//   constant (see `ending-banner-ending.tsx`/`ending-rail-ending.tsx`'s own
//   "孤儿色处理" header comment, migrated verbatim from the original
//   `templates/*.tsx` sources, predating this wave) deliberately fainter
//   than `colors.muted` by design. Confirmed theme-wide-independent: the
//   same theme's `tone-adaptive-ending`/`masthead-ending` render the
//   identical copyright text with zero low-contrast finding — the gap is
//   specific to these two layouts' own long-standing color choice, not
//   something task T1/T2 introduced, and it was simply never exercised with
//   real contact/copyright content before (`full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`'s
//   own file header: deliberately meta-free; `audit-baseline.test.ts`
//   auto-picks a layout, unlikely to land on this exact pairing). Out of
//   this task's contract (which scopes the forced audit to overflow/
//   out-of-bounds/overlap) and orthogonal to the theme-structure wave's own
//   change — flagged here for whoever next owns contrast-policy cleanup,
//   not fixed or allowlisted by this task.
//   **Resolved (contrast-policy wave, Task T1):** both `COPYRIGHT_FAINT`
//   orphan constants are gone, replaced by `metaInk(colors.muted, bg)`
//   (`../render/ink.ts`) tagged `data-contrast-tier="meta"` — see
//   `ending-banner-ending.tsx`/`ending-rail-ending.tsx`'s own rewritten
//   header comments for the new ruling (docs/contrast-system.md's B-tier
//   meta-information-text policy) and `deck-audit.test.ts`'s "meta" tests
//   for the audit-side mechanism. This exact fixture (consulting/
//   banner-ending, academic/rail-ending, real contact/copyright meta) no
//   longer produces a low-contrast finding. Left in place, not deleted —
//   git archaeology for why this bullet used to matter.
//   Note also: this comment's own numbers were transposed at authoring time
//   — real measurement (`findContrastIssues` against the actual rendered
//   markup) puts `consulting/banner-ending` at 3.22:1 and
//   `academic/rail-ending` at 2.93:1, the reverse of the labels above. The
//   ratios themselves were never wrong, only which theme/layout pair
//   they were filed under — carried into `.issues/roadmap.md` and
//   `.issues/2026-07-28-contrast-policy/plan.md` unchecked. See
//   task-1-report.md for the correction.
// - `low-contrast` on `runway/fashion-chapter`'s org label (4.06:1, needs
//   4.5:1): the same shape a former `tech/fashion-masthead` ALLOWLIST entry
//   used to adjudicate (~4.16:1, "a rounding distance under the floor,
//   deferred to a future theme-polish pass"). That entry is gone now
//   (fashion-masthead metaInk migration,
//   `.issues/2026-08-04-fashion-masthead-metaink/task-1-report.md`) — its
//   own layout migrated to B-tier `metaInk`, measured 3:1 instead of the
//   old 4.5:1 body line. `fashion-chapter`'s org label is a separate code
//   path (different file, different background token) that migration
//   deliberately left untouched: it already clears the real B-tier 3:1
//   floor (4.056:1, the worst case across all 16 themes), so it's not a
//   current defect, just still deferred theme-polish scope.
