   *
   * Same reasoning as `cardStroke` above — the emphasis renderers are shared
   * across every theme and must stay theme-agnostic — but the pressure is
   * different. `accent` answers to the page background: it has to stay legible
   * where it is painted. An emphasis run answers to the *text it interrupts*:
   * it has to look different from the words on either side of it. Most themes
   * have one colour that does both. A theme whose accent is a near-neutral in
   * the same family as its text ink does not, and its marked runs read as
   * faded rather than emphasised (stage, whose muted silver sits 1.60:1 from
   * its own paper white). Splitting the token lets such a theme keep its
   * accent for decoration and name a second ink for emphasis.
   *
   * `themes/definitions.test.ts` pins the separation rule for all built-ins.

  /**
   * Optional semantic-role colors — the "this is an error", "this is a
   * caution", "this is a good result" trio that shared component renderers
   * used to bake in as literal hexes (`callout`'s warn rule and icon in
   * components/callout.tsx, `kpi_cards`' delta arrow in components/kpi.tsx).
   * Same reasoning as `cardStroke` above: those renderers are shared across
   * every theme and must stay theme-agnostic (no `if (themeId === ...)`
   * branching), so a theme that wants its own red or green sets these tokens
   * and the renderers read them through `resolveSemanticColor`
   * (`src/render/ink.ts`), which owns the fallback order.
   *
   * All three are optional on the type, and an omitted role resolves to
   * exactly the hex its renderers baked in before this channel existed —
   * `#DC2626` for `danger`, `#16A34A` for `success`, and `warning` follows
   * whatever `danger` resolves to. So a theme that sets none of them renders
   * byte-for-byte as it did before the tokens were added.
   *
   * Every one of the 22 built-in themes does set all three (visual review
   * round 4 ruled that the alert color must belong to the theme's own
   * palette, not be one universal red), so in practice only a `--theme-file`
   * brand theme reaches the fallbacks. `danger` and `success` are calibrated
   * to clear 4.5:1 on their own theme's `surface` — they render as the kpi
   * delta arrow's *text*, which `accessibleInk` would otherwise demote to
   * neutral ink — while `warning` only has to clear the 3:1 non-text floor,
   * since `callout` paints it as a rule and an icon. Both floors are pinned
   * in `svg/audit/full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`.
