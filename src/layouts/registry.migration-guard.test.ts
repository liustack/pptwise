// T1d (src domain reorg wave 1) migration guard — ONE-TIME, may be deleted
// in a later wave once the layoutDef-inlining migration is trusted.
//
// `__fixtures__/pre-migration-layout-registry.json` is a one-time capture
// (see the task report for the capture method — a temporary
// `__tmp-dump-registry.test.ts`, deleted before this commit, that imported
// the pre-migration `LAYOUT_REGISTRY` — still built from literal
// `COVER_LAYOUT_DEFS`/`CHAPTER_LAYOUT_DEFS`/`ENDING_LAYOUT_DEFS`/`CONTENT_LAYOUT_DEFS`/
// `TAKEOVER_LAYOUT_DEFS` Records — and serialized it). This test replays the
// post-migration aggregator (`LAYOUT_REGISTRY` rebuilt from `layoutDef`
// imports scattered across `layouts/*.tsx` + `image-pages.tsx`) and
// asserts it is unchanged, both in content (every definition, deep-equal)
// and in key order (insertion order feeds `layoutsForSlideType`'s
// `Object.values` walk, which feeds `theme.layouts[type]`'s array order,
// which `resolveLayoutId`'s `weightedPickBySeed` samples from
// positionally — a silent reorder would not fail typecheck or most tests,
// but would silently redistribute deterministic seed-based layout picks).
//
// The comparison is restricted to the fields the capture actually holds.
// `LayoutDefinition` has grown optional metadata since (`narrativesOnly`,
// `pinOnly`, `headingFit`, `paintsOwnBackground`), and a layout that sets one
// of those is not a layout the migration changed — it is a later, deliberate
// decision that this fixture was never a record of. Comparing whole objects
// made the first such decision look like a migration defect and would have
// been answered by re-recording a file whose entire value is that it was
// captured *before* the migration and never touched again. Removals and
// changes to captured fields still fail, which is the thing this guard is
// here to catch.
