// no-action -- this table needs no per-role safety factor for Georgia or
// Microsoft YaHei. Full corpus and methodology: task-3-report.md
// (borrow-wave scratchpad, not shipped in this repo).
//
// Separately (not a width-calibration finding, recorded here since it
// surfaced during this same measurement): neither Georgia nor Consolas
// (src/components/code.tsx) has any CJK glyph in its `cmap` at all --
// a CJK character in text declared under either face never renders from
// that face -- PowerPoint substitutes some other, currently uncontrolled
// font at the glyph level. That is a font-identity gap, not a width-
// estimation gap, and no width safety factor can address it -- see
// task-3-report.md's "unexpected findings" section.
// Bold-width correction (bold-metrics fix, 2026-07-24; upgraded to an exact
// per-character model in round 2, same date, after a controller-ordered

// be the right fix is the load-bearing lesson, not just this file's own
// history:
//
// Round 1 found the data pack's verbatim per-class averages insufficient
// (real renders of "Components Demo" still clipped on both Georgia and
// YaHei) and patched it with a flat 1.2x margin on the classes that broke.
// A controller-ordered review (this task's own bold-metrics-fix-review,
// scratchpad) then found real, ordinary (not synthetic) headings that
// *still* clipped through that margin -- "Maximum Momentum Wave" (Georgia
// Bold, "Wave"'s trailing "e" cut off the canvas edge) and "MEGAMARKET
// MOMENTUM" (Georgia Bold, "MARKET"'s trailing "T" cut off) -- both
// LibreOffice-confirmed. The reviewer's independent fontTools hmtx read of
// the genuine Georgia Bold.ttf explains exactly why a margin could never
// have closed this gap: `lowerDigit`'s single widest real character, "m",
// has a true advance of 1.0156em -- a 1.8136x ratio over the class's
// assumed 0.56em weight -- while round 1's margined factor
// (1.0461 x 1.2 = 1.2553x) covered barely two thirds of that gap. Georgia's
// `upper` class (which round 1 left *unmargined*, reasoned "independently
// verified tight" against this corpus's own worst sampled string) has the
// same structural problem in the other direction: "W" has a true advance
// of 1.1265em against an assumed 0.66em weight -- a +51.8% deviation, not
// the +12.42% the sampled corpus average suggested.
//
// The generalizable lesson: a class average -- however large the corpus,
// however small the measured deviation, margined or not -- describes the
// *typical* member of an open-ended character class, never its bound. Any
// margin chosen to clear the worst case *known at the time* (round 1's two
// failing strings) is definitionally unfalsifiable against a worst case
// *not yet tried* (round 2's two new ones) -- there is no principled stopping
// point short of the class's true maximum (1.8136x for `lowerDigit`, which
// would in turn over-shrink the overwhelming majority of ordinary headings
// that never come near that character). The only way to be simultaneously
// exact for typical headings and safe for adversarial ones is to stop
// averaging altogether -- which is what the exact per-character tables
// below do for the two faces this task has genuine Bold binaries for.
// SimSun/KaiTi (`SIMSUN_KAITI` below) keep a class-average model, unchanged
// from round 1 apart from also losing their own `LOWER_DIGIT_MARGIN` factor
// -- but that removal doesn't reopen the same hole, because SimSun/KaiTi's
// Latin glyphs have *zero* measured per-character variance in the first
// place (every probed character sits at exactly 0.5em, `bold-data-pack.md`
// S2 -- a rigid design grid, not a statistical average with a long tail),
// so there is no "worst individual character beats the average" case for a
// class average to fail to bound. See `SIMSUN_KAITI`'s own comment for the
// full argument.
//
// Per-class factors below (now used only as the exact-model faces' rare
// fallback, and as `SIMSUN_KAITI`/`ENVELOPE`'s only model) are
// `bold_real_em / assumed_estimator_weight`, read verbatim off this task's
// data pack (`bold-data-pack.json` `derived_bold_factors`, `bold-data-
// pack.md` for full methodology/provenance/corpus -- scratchpad, not
// shipped in this repo, dated 2026-07-24), with no margin layered on top
// (see EPITAPH above for why not). Georgia/Microsoft YaHei's numbers are
// `genuine-file-hmtx`; SimSun/KaiTi have no genuine Bold binary anywhere
// (exhaustively searched, `bold-data-pack.md` S1) so theirs stay

// (does Georgia's own Bold growth rate even transplant validly onto
// SimSun/KaiTi's un-measurable faux-bold rendering, a cross-face
// extrapolation question, not a within-class variance question) was

// doesn't flex for other either), so `regular` and `bold` are equal here --
// the one asymmetry in this file, and the reason this correction folds in
// regardless of the caller's `bold` flag. `other` uses the clean-corpus
// value (1.2235) rather than the raw corpus's more pessimistic 1.2846: the
// raw corpus is contaminated by one U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT character a separate,
// pre-existing `WIDE_CHAR_RE` coverage gap misclassifies as "other" instead
// of CJK-wide -- folding that unrelated bug into this factor would
// overcorrect for the wrong reason (bold-data-pack.md S2 side-finding 2).

// below already ships with (monospace fonts don't kern at all, so that
// model never had this caveat), now inherited by a proportional model
// where kerning genuinely exists but is second-order. Round-2 review
// estimated the resulting shaping-level uncertainty at roughly 1-2
// percentage points on a typical multi-word heading -- small next to the
// tens-of-percent gaps the exact model closes, and safe-directional, not

// a genuinely monospace face, where "character-class width" isn't a
// heuristic to approximate, it's a known constant: every glyph advances
// the same fixed amount, read directly off the font.
//
// Consolas's own `hmtx` (advance-width) table gives 1126 font units at
// unitsPerEm=2048 for *every* glyph sampled (space, upper, lower, digit,
// punctuation alike):
//   MONO_ADVANCE_EM = 1126 / 2048 = 0.5498 em
// -- the defining, unfakeable signature of a monospace face (contrast
// Georgia's 0.24-0.66 em spread across character classes in the
// calibration note above `measureTextUnits`. A variable-width font simply
// cannot show this uniformity). Measured twice, independently, to the same
// 4 decimal places: borrow-wave Task 3's fontTools `hmtx` read of the
// genuine Consolas.ttf (Microsoft Office for Mac's private font bundle,
// identity-confirmed via that file's own `name` table), and that task's
// review, which re-derived it from a from-scratch Node.js sfnt/hmtx parser
// sharing no code with fontTools (see task-3-report.md / task-3-review.md,
// borrow-wave scratchpad, not shipped in this repo).
//
// The proportional weights structurally underestimate this face's
// whitespace and punctuation as a result (+57.1%/+19.5% real-vs-assumed
// for the space/"other" classes, same corpus) -- and that gap has no
// ceiling: it grows with indentation depth, since a deep-indent line is
// almost entirely the single most-underestimated class. See
// MONO_WIDTH_SAFETY's derivation comment in code.tsx for what that did to
// the safety-factor approach this model replaces.
//
// The one exception: CJK/wide characters (`WIDE_CHAR_RE`, shared with
// `measureTextUnits` above) stay at 1.0 em/char, not 0.5498. Consolas's
// `cmap` contains zero CJK glyphs at all (task-3-report.md's S4.1 finding,
// exhaustively re-verified in task-3-review.md by scanning every cmap
// segment/group, not sampling) -- a CJK character declared under a mono
// role never actually renders from Consolas. PowerPoint silently
// substitutes some other, uncontrolled font at the glyph level. That
// substituted font's real metrics are unknowable (it isn't even
// deterministic which font it will be), so this keeps the same 1.0 em/char
// assumption `measureTextUnits`'s WIDE_CHAR_RE class already uses for CJK
// (consistent with the sibling measurement of Microsoft YaHei's CJK class
// landing at +0.16%, i.e. ~1em -- see the calibration note above
// `measureTextUnits`) rather than invent a new, unmeasured number. This is
// a font-identity gap, not a metrics gap -- fonts.ts originally recorded it
// as a known, unresolved risk no width model could fix, and has since
// closed it (a:ea follow-up task -- `eaFontFaceFor` plus the JSZip patch in
// `src/pptx/pptx-ea-fonts.ts`): a mono-role CJK character now
// deterministically renders from Microsoft YaHei, exactly the face this
// 1.0 em/char estimate already assumed. No change needed to this model --
// it was betting on that face before the fix existed, and the fix made the
// bet true (see `eaFontFaceFor`'s own doc comment in fonts.ts for that

// line boundary. The playbill deck cover, "《候鸟旅馆》毕业公演", split as
// 「《候鸟旅馆」/「》毕业公演」 — a closing book-title mark opening a line,
// which no Chinese, Japanese, or Korean typesetting convention permits.
//
// ONE rule, one place. Every line break this repo produces for an SVG page
// goes through `wrapWithUnits` or `splitLongToken` below (`layoutSvgText`,
// `balanceWrappedLines`, and the floor refit all call `wrapWithUnits`;
// `fitHeadingLines`/`fitSvgLine` and every layout/component call site reach
// them through `layoutSvgText`), so both consult `allowsLineBreakBetween`

//
// SET SELECTION. Curated from the intersection of three references — CSS
// Text's `line-break: strict` prohibition classes, JIS X 4051's 行頭/行末
// 禁則 tables, and 中文排版需求 (clreq) §3.1.6 — narrowed to what this
// product's authoring corpus can actually carry (Simplified Chinese plus
// English, with the occasional shared CJK mark). Deliberate exclusions,
// each for a stated reason rather than an oversight:
//
//   - ASCII sentence punctuation (`,` `.` `:` `;` `!` `?` `%`). Their
//     fullwidth twins are in the set; the halfwidth forms are
//     overwhelmingly Latin-context, where `tokenize`'s space-delimited
//     branch already glues them onto their own word, so a line can never
//     begin with one anyway. Forbidding them buys nothing and would put
//     English word wrapping at risk for no gain.
//   - ASCII straight quotes (`"` `'`). Direction-ambiguous — UAX #14 class
//     QU, the same character opens and closes — so no rule can tell whether
//     a given one belongs at a line head or a line tail. The unambiguous
//     curly forms are in the sets instead.
//   - U+2014 EM DASH. Chinese uses the doubled 破折号 "——" freely at a line
//     head (dialogue, attribution), and UAX #14 classes it B2 — a break
//     opportunity on both sides, not a prohibition.
//   - Currency prefixes (`$` `￥` `€`). JIS X 4051 forbids them at line end;
//     no theme or corpus text in this repo places one before a line break,
//     so they stay out of a set that is meant to be justified, not maximal.
//   - Japanese small kana (ぁぃぅ…ャュョッ) and the sokuon. Standard in any
//     Japanese kinsoku table, but this product authors Simplified Chinese
//     and English; adding an unexercised script's rules would be guessing.
//
// Both classes are single-character tests. Callers pass one code unit at a
// time; an astral-plane character arrives as a lone surrogate, matches
// neither class, and is therefore treated as freely breakable — the safe
// direction (no CJK punctuation lives outside the BMP).

// Atomic-run pattern for tokenize()'s no-space branch below (task R2,
// 2026-07-24). CJK's own wrapping convention allows a break between any
// two ideographs but never inside a run of Latin letters/digits -- this
// repo's own fused heading idiom glues an English brand/metric prefix
// straight onto a CJK clause with no separating space (e.g. "DSpark：让大
// 模型推理快..."). The old no-space tokenizer (`Array.from(normalized)`)
// split every character individually, so a Latin run had no protection at
// all: the greedy per-token line pack (`wrapWithUnits` below) could end a
// line after any single character, landing squarely mid-word once the line
// budget got tight (empirically: ~20 fused-prefix characters at
// cover-left-anchor's 360px budget) -- silently, since a wrap/shrink that
// still lands under budget never touched `truncateToUnits`, so `truncated`
// stayed `false`.
//
// This regex instead matches a maximal run starting in `[A-Za-z0-9]`, with
// `.`/`-`/`%` allowed *inside* the run so a hyphen/decimal/percent doesn't
// fracture a token that reads as one visual unit ("60-85%", "v2.3.1-rc.4"
// each stay a single atomic token). `.` and `-` are never the run's own
// first or last character, so a trailing connector splits off as its own
// single-char token ("etc." → ["etc", "."]) and a leading one likewise
// ("-flag" → ["-", "flag"]): a break can still land next to those two
// connectors, just never inside the alphanumeric run itself. `%` is exempt
// from that trailing restriction -- it's allowed to close a run ("85%"
// stays whole, unlike "etc.") -- and because the run keeps extending past
// it whenever more alphanumerics follow with no space or punctuation in
// between, a percent sign glued directly onto a following word fuses into
// the same atomic token too: "50%off" tokenizes as the single token
// `"50%off"`, not `["50%", "off"]`. Every
// other character (CJK, punctuation, and deliberately -- see below --
// anything outside ASCII) falls through to the trailing `.` alternative,
// one token per character, unchanged from the old `Array.from` behavior --
// which is what keeps pure-CJK and already-space-delimited text (that
// branch is untouched) byte-identical to pre-fix output.
//
// Deliberately ASCII-only (`[A-Za-z0-9]`, not `\p{L}`/`\p{N}`): an accented
// Latin letter (é, ü) or any other non-CJK, non-ASCII script does NOT
// extend a run -- "café" tokenizes as `["caf", "é"]`, so a break could
// still land between "caf" and "é" under a tight budget. That is a real,
// known boundary, not silently widened past what this task's brief scoped
// (ASCII alphanumerics) -- see the tokenize() doc comment and this task's
// report for the full self-review of mixed-script/connector edge cases.
//
// `splitLongToken` below is intentionally untouched: it remains the
// fallback for the rare case where an atomic run alone is wider than a
// full line (a run that long still can't be rendered unbroken in a bounded
// box -- there is no alternative to a mid-run cut there), now reached with

  // Word-integrity preference (task R2 retry-ladder scope extension,
  // 2026-07-24): the ladder above always converges on the *largest* font
  // that satisfies `maxLines`, and character-level `splitLongToken` output
  // can always hit any target line count at a smaller-or-equal `maxUnits`
  // than keeping a run whole -- so whenever the legacy search needed a
  // retry at all, it tends to land on a budget that still cuts an atomic
  // Latin/digit run mid-run (the Critical finding: a run at string position
  // 0, with no leading CJK to absorb line 1, hits this every time the run
  // alone doesn't already fit the requested font size).
  //
  // Gate strictly on `legacyHadSplit` (the *selected* candidate's own split
  // state, not merely whether the very first attempt had one): whenever the
  // legacy search's own answer is already split-free -- the overwhelming
  // majority of real content, including every pure-CJK and space-delimited
  // input -- this whole branch is skipped and `lines` stays `legacyLines`
  // verbatim, with zero extra `wrapWithUnits` calls beyond what today's
  // code already makes. This is what makes "must not change any layout
  // where no split ever occurs" a property of the selection rule, not
  // merely an observed test result.
  //
  // When it *does* need to search: `minSplitFreeUnits` is the exact
  // narrowest `maxUnits` at which every no-space run individually fits (see
  // `WrapResult`), so jumping straight there -- rather than geometric-
  // guessing for it -- is provably the largest-font split-free candidate,
  // if it satisfies `maxLines`. `minSplitFreeUnits` is always strictly
  // greater than whatever `maxUnits` the legacy search stopped at whenever
  // `legacyHadSplit` is true (proof: `hadSplit` true means some run's own
  // width exceeded that `maxUnits`, and `minSplitFreeUnits` is the max over
  // every such run's width) -- so this search only ever shrinks the font
  // from the legacy answer, never grows it. Growing `maxUnits` further from
  // there can only keep or reduce `lines.length` and keep or reduce the
  // resulting font size (both monotonic in `maxUnits`), so a candidate is
  // rejected and the search advances only while a smaller font might still
  // recover `maxLines`; the instant a candidate's own font would already
  // sit under `minPt` (when the caller declared one), further growth can
  // only make it worse, so the search stops rather than wasting steps.
  //
  // If no admissible (maxLines-satisfying, minPt-respecting) split-free
  // candidate exists in-budget -- a run genuinely wider than a full line
  // even at `minPt`, or `maxLines` itself unreachable without splitting --
  // `lines` stays `legacyLines`: the documented fallback, split rather than
  // drop content, never worse than today.
  //
  // Search ceiling: when the caller declared `minPt`, that floor alone
  // bounds the search (the loop body's own `fontSizeFor(...) >= minPt`
  // check) -- `stepCap` below is then a generous, practically-unreachable
  // termination safety net (see the monotonicity argument above), not the
  // real stopping condition. Without a `minPt` -- no call site in this
  // codebase omits it except a handful of non-heading `layoutSvgText`
  // callers and this file's own `minPt`-omitting tests -- there is no
  // caller-declared floor to search within, so `reachCeilingUnits` instead
  // caps the search at the exact `maxUnits` the pre-existing (pre-task-R2-
  // retry-ladder-fix) ladder could already reach on its own
  // (`baseUnits * 1.14^8`, the same 8-retry budget the legacy loop above
  // uses). This is what keeps the preference from ever shrinking a
  // `minPt`-less call's font further than the *original* algorithm's own
  // worst case already could -- it only ever reorders which
  // already-in-reach candidate wins, it does not grant the ladder new
  // reach. (Concretely: without this, a run wider than any line the
  // original ladder could ever have produced -- this file's own
  // "Supercalifragilistic..." self-review case -- would shrink the font
  // without bound chasing word integrity, instead of falling back to
  // `splitLongToken` the way it always has.)
