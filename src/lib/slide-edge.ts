/**
 * The paint a preview surface must put *behind* a mounted slide.
 *
 * Every surface that shows a slide in HTML — `../cli/preview-html.ts`, the
 * review gallery, the DSH panel — drops the standalone `<svg viewBox="0 0
 * 1280 720">` into a 16:9 box and stretches it to fill (`width:100%;
 * height:100%`). That box almost never lands on whole device pixels: its
 * width comes out of a grid track, a `min()` against the viewport, or a
 * container query, so the slide's own left and right edges routinely sit at,
 * say, x=53.33 and x=1386.67.
 *
 * A browser paints that boundary column twice. First the box's own
 * background, at partial coverage; then the SVG on top of it, at the same
 * partial coverage. What survives is `(1-a)*a` of the box's background —
 * roughly a fifth to a quarter of it — in a one-to-two pixel strip down the
 * slide's edge. When the box is painted in a neutral light grey and the
 * slide is dark, that strip reads as a pale vertical line hugging the page,
 * which is exactly what the 2026-08-20 review reported on rally p01/p02,
 * ink p01/p03 and ledger p07. Measured, not reasoned about: setting the
 * gallery's stage colour to magenta turned the line magenta, and setting it
 * to the slide's own background made the line disappear.
 *
 * There is no way to stop the double-paint from the slide's side. The SVG
 * cannot paint outside its own viewBox, an outset plus `overflow:hidden`
 * just moves the same antialiased boundary onto the clip, and forcing a
 * compositing layer makes it worse. What does work is giving that boundary
 * nothing foreign to blend with: paint the box in the slide's own edge
 * colour, and the surviving fraction is the colour that was already there.
 *
 * The exported PPTX has no equivalent defect — the slide is 13.33in wide and
 * the background shape converts to 13.3333in, so it overhangs rather than
 * falls short.
