// Proportional-role golden anchors (test/proportional-golden-anchors branch,
// 2026-07-22). Closes the last piece of the layout/audit "shared blindness"
// gap borrow-wave Task 3 flagged: `measureTextUnits` (this file) and
// `svg-audit.ts`'s overflow detector both compute width from the exact same
// per-character-class weight table, so no test that only calls
// `measureTextUnits` and asserts against `measureTextUnits`'s own output can
// ever catch that table drifting away from what real fonts actually render
// -- a tautology, not a check. Task 3's fix round closed this for the MONO
// role by replacing the heuristic with an exact, hmtx-derived model and
// pinning it against real Consolas advance widths read straight from the
// font file (`measureMonoTextUnits`'s golden anchors,
// `src/components/code.test.tsx`, commits bf6131e/f585f6a). The
// PROPORTIONAL roles (heading/body) can't get the same treatment -- Georgia
// and Microsoft YaHei are genuinely variable-width, so "exact model" isn't
// on the table -- but Task 3's original measurement round already read the
// real per-character-class advance widths for both faces off their own
// `hmtx` tables (fontTools, cross-validated to 4 decimal places against a
// real Chromium `canvas.measureText()` reading of the identical files --
// full method in `measureTextUnits`'s own calibration comment above and
// task-3-report.md, borrow-wave scratchpad, not shipped in this repo) and
// concluded the weight table is within tolerance for both faces. That
// measured data -- not `measureTextUnits`'s own arithmetic -- is this file's
// anchor source, exactly as the task brief for this branch specified.
//
// What this catches: if a future change nudges `measureTextUnits`'s class
// weights (0.35/0.66/0.56/0.46/1.0) away from these real-font numbers by
// more than the measured-safe band below, every anchor here goes red loudly
// -- there is no shared formula left for a regression to hide behind.

// Per-class real advance widths (em/char), read from the two faces' own
// `hmtx` tables -- borrow-wave Task 3, 2026-07-21, fontTools on
// `/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Georgia.ttf` (genuine macOS system
// font) and the genuine Microsoft-shipped
// `.../Office for Mac's private font bundle/msyh.ttc` (identity-confirmed
// via each file's own `name` table, not a visually-similar stand-in).
// Values are corpus averages per class (Georgia: 415 classified chars
// across 9 sentences -- YaHei: 339 classified chars across 10 sentences) --
// task-3-report.md S3, `results.json`'s `class_summary`, scratchpad not
// shipped. The rounded percentage form of these same numbers is already
// cited in `measureTextUnits`'s own calibration comment above -- these are
// the exact decimals behind that prose.

// between what `measureTextUnits` assumes for that exact text today and
// what Task 3 measured as real for it -- plus a flat 1.5 percentage-point
// margin, rounded UP to the nearest 0.5%. A single band sized to the
// corpus's worst blended-string deviation (e.g. a uniform 15%/5%) would sit
// far looser than a class-pure anchor's own near-zero measured deviation,
// leaving that anchor's class weight essentially unguarded -- a 5% drift in
// a weight whose real deviation was already near zero would still land well
// inside a loose uniform band. Per-anchor bands close that: each anchor's
// margin is sized to what was actually measured for *that* text, so a
// same-magnitude drift in any weight the file exercises has to cross a band
// close to what it actually has to clear, not the corpus's loosest case.

// gap and the two weight-drift mutations below that confirm the fix.)
