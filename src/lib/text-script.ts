/**
 * One question, asked of a label's own characters: may this text be set as a
 * top-to-bottom column of single characters?
 *
 * Axis titles never call this. They sit as a horizontal pair
 * (`axis-titles.tsx`: "名  →" / "名  ↑"). The remaining caller is ink
 * heading treatments (`heading-treatments/render.tsx`), where a CJK
 * heading may still stack one `<text>` node per character. That is
 * ordinary typography for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, whose glyphs are
 * square and carry meaning one at a time. It is not typography at all
 * for a Latin word: "Tempo" comes out as T/e/m/p/o down the page, and a
 * reader has to reassemble the word letter by letter (2026-08-20 review,
 * `component--heatmap--mixed` and `component--matrix--en`). When this
 * returns false, the heading stays as one horizontal line. The svg2pptx
 * rotate path stays for other scenes.
 *
 * The rule is content-driven and total: same string in, same answer out, no
 * locale, config or seed involved, so a deck's stacked headings look the
 * same on every machine and across every revision.
 *
 * **Mixed-script labels do not stack.** The test is an allowlist over every
 * character, not a majority vote over the string: one Latin run inside an
 * otherwise-Chinese label ("K8s 托管") is exactly the defect — a majority rule
 * would still shatter "K8s" into K/8/s while calling the label Chinese. The
 * asymmetry is deliberate: a Chinese label set horizontally is merely less
 * traditional, a Latin word set vertically is unreadable, so every uncertain
 * case resolves toward horizontal.
 *
 * Deliberately a third character table rather than a reuse of the two that
 * already exist: `svg-text-layout.ts`'s `WIDE_CHAR_RE` classifies characters
 * for *width measurement*, and `people-initials.ts`'s `CJK_IDEOGRAPH_RE`
 * picks a *badge letter*. Neither answers this question, and widening either
 * one to cover all three jobs would tie three unrelated behaviors together.
