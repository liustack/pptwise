/**
 * Deck spec schema + validation (spec §5 "plan artifact and hard gates", W5
 * task 2 — renamed to "Deck Spec" per the vocabulary-v4 rename, spec §6/§8.1;
 * "spec §N" citations throughout this file that predate this rename still
 * point at that original W5 design doc, not this rename's own spec — left
 * as historical citations, not renumbered). That rename originally covered
 * the exported concepts and CLI vocabulary only — this module's own
 * directory stayed `src/plan` for a while after, a known stale name the
 * src domain-reorg wave's task T1c closed by moving it to `src/spec`
 * (mechanical `git mv`, every exported symbol unchanged): the path now
 * matches the vocabulary this header already used throughout.
 *
 * A deck spec is a workflow artifact, not a render prerequisite (spec §5's
 * "escape hatch": a bare IR v3 renders directly, `spec validate` is a
 * separate, optional gate for the spec-authoring stage of the six-phase
 * workflow). This module stays pure and Node-free — no `fs`, no CLI concerns
 * — so it can sit in `src/index.ts`'s dependency closure exactly like
 * `src/ir` and `src/narrative` already do (`AGENTS.md`'s layout rule).
 * `src/cli/commands.ts` owns the one Node-touching wrapper
 * (`runSpecValidate`: read file, call {@link validateSpec}, format the
 * result).
 *
 * Design mirrors `api.ts`'s `validateIr`/`ValidateResult` throughout
 * (structural zod pass first, then a sequential chain of hard-gate
 * categories, each short-circuiting the chain on its own failure — see
 * {@link validateSpec}'s own comment for why): same overall shape, adapted
 * for spec pages being keyed by an author-assigned `id` instead of IR's
 * positional slide index.

 * narrative, so nothing past the narrative/theme stage runs until that
 * resolves cleanly. Every spec-gate philosophy here is "hard block, no soft
 * warning" (spec §5's "escape hatch" section — a spec that doesn't fit this shape
 * should be authored as bare IR instead, not warned-and-shipped).
 *
 * Before the schema parse, {@link normalizeNarrativeShape} (`../narrative`,
 * T0b fix 2 scope extension) runs on the raw input, exactly mirroring
 * `validateIr`'s own pre-parse pass (`../validate-core.ts`) — a top-level
 * `narrative: {id: "<preset>"}` shape is rewritten to the bare preset
 * string before `DeckSpecSchema.safeParse` ever sees it, so the correction
 * lands in the returned `spec` itself (read again by `checkBeatRotation`/
 * `checkFocusVocabulary`/`checkPageCount` below, and by `runSpecValidate`'s
 * own OK-summary line, `../cli/commands.ts`), not just this function's own
 * local `resolveNarrative` call below. Every return path is wrapped in
 * `withNormalized` so the rewrite note (`SpecValidateResult.normalized`)
 * surfaces on success *or* failure, success or failure alike — same
