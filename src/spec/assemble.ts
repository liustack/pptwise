/**
 * assembleDeck / disassembleDeck — deck spec + per-page content → IR, and
 * back (spec §5's "assemble is a pure SDK function", W5 task 3; the spec
 * artifact itself renamed from "plan" to "spec" per the vocabulary-v4
 * rename, spec §6/§8.1 — old "spec §N" citations throughout this file
 * predate that rename and still cite the original W5 design doc, left as
 * historical citations, not renumbered).
 *
 * `assembleDeck` is the pure-function half of the deck-project directory
 * concept (spec §7): a locked {@link DeckSpec} (§5's workflow artifact,
 * validated by `validateSpec` in `./index.ts`) plus a `pages` record keyed
 * by page id, materialized into a renderable {@link PptxIR}. The CLI's
 * directory wrapper (W5 task 5, not this file) is the only Node-touching
 * piece — it reads `deck.spec.json` + `pages/<id>.json` off disk and calls
 * straight through to {@link assembleDeck}, exactly like `src/cli/commands.ts`
 * already wraps `validateIr`/`validateSpec`. This module itself stays zero-fs
 * (no `node:*` imports, nothing from `src/cli*` or `src/platform/node.ts`) so
 * it can sit in `src/index.ts`'s dependency closure (`AGENTS.md`'s layout
 * rule) — the exact same posture `./index.ts` (this folder's schema/validate
 * module) already holds, documented in that file's own top comment.
 *
 * `assembleDeck` also materializes each page's effective layout id into its
 * own `layout` field when the page file omitted one (W4 design decision 10):
 * once the IR above is built and schema-validated, every slide whose
 * `layout` is still unset gets exactly what `resolveEffectiveLayoutId`
 * (`../svg/layout-selection.ts`) resolves for it — the same function the
 * render chain itself calls, so `deck.json` never carries a second,
 * independently-derived guess at what a page will render as (see this
 * module's own {@link materializeEffectiveLayouts} for the mechanics). A page
 * whose file already set `layout` is left untouched. `../svg/layout-selection.ts`
 * is a pure function with no Node-only import anywhere in its own closure and
 * nothing in that closure imports back from `src/spec`, so depending on it
 * from here adds a new edge, not a cycle, and does not pull anything
 * Node-only into `src/index.ts`'s dependency closure.
 *
 * `disassembleDeck` is the documented-lossy inverse (spec §7: "disassemble
 * — the inverse of assemble, an optional tail item for W5"): it reconstructs a spec + pages record from
 * an existing IR, well enough that re-`assembleDeck`-ing the result
 * reproduces the same slide content, but spec-only fields that never made it
 * into the IR in the first place (`focus`, and `summary` on a filled content
 * page) cannot be recovered. See that function's own doc
 * comment for the full accounting. `beat` *did* have this same "never made
 * it into the IR" status until the P1 variety wave's task 1 gave it a real
 * `Slide.beat` field (`../ir/index.ts`) — it is now a plain passthrough on
 * both sides, same as `layout`/`heading`, no longer in this lossy list.

/**
 * Assemble a validated deck spec plus a per-page content record into a
 * renderable IR. See this module's own top comment for the overall shape.
 * Step numbers below match the W5 task-3 brief's own numbered "inject
 * semantics" list verbatim — kept in that exact order because two of them
 * (locked-field vs. orphan) both throw and their relative order is
 * otherwise unobservable from either doc comment alone.
 *
 * 1. `spec` is `unknown` (same boundary `validateSpec` itself has — a spec
 *    is almost always freshly `JSON.parse`d off disk by the caller) —
 *    invalid shape or a failed hard gate throws {@link PptpressError} with
 *    `validateSpec`'s own formatted issue list, not a re-derived message.
 * 2. Shape guard + locked-field protection: a `pages[id]` entry must first be
 *    a plain object — not `null`, an array, or a primitive — else throws.
 *    `pages` is `unknown`-shaped off disk same as `spec` itself (step 1), so
 *    a JSON `null`/string/array content value is a real possibility, not
 *    just a type-system hole, and `Object.hasOwn` throws its own
 *    uninformative native `TypeError` on `null` (and silently no-ops on a
 *    string/array/number) rather than this gate's own readable message.
 *    Once that holds, a `pages[id]` entry that carries a `type` or `heading`
 *    *key* — even set to `undefined` — throws. `Object.hasOwn`, not a
 *    `!== undefined` read, is what makes that "even `undefined`" case
 *    catchable: `PageContent` itself never declares either field, but a
 *    page file freshly parsed off disk is `unknown` before it reaches this
 *    function's declared `PageContent` parameter type, so a stray
 *    `"heading": null`-turned-`undefined` or a copy-pasted empty key is
 *    exactly the drift this gate exists to catch instead of silently
 *    ignoring.
 * 3. Orphan keys: a `pages` entry whose id isn't any spec page's id. Listed
 *    together with a fix suggestion, checked only after every present page
 *    has cleared the locked-field gate (step 2) — an orphan file that
 *    *also* happens to redeclare `heading` reports as locked-field first.
 * 4. Missing pages (a spec id with no `pages` entry) become a placeholder
 *    slide — never an error. Spec §7's own words: "assemble's precise
 *    semantics — a missing page always succeeds (placeholder), a structural
 *    contradiction (orphan file / bad spec / id conflict) errors". A
 *    declared `summary` becomes the placeholder's `subheading` so a
 *    `--draft` preview of an unfilled deck still reads as more than a bare
 *    "Untitled". Step 5 preserves the same visible line for filled boundary
 *    pages while keeping it fill-only on filled content pages. A declared
 *    `beat` carries straight into the
 *    placeholder's own `Slide.beat` too (P1 variety wave, task 1 — see step
 *    5's note below). A placeholder page still participates in this
 *    function's own layout materialization below, so its beat still needs
 *    to reach the IR for that weighting to see it once the page is filled
 *    in later without re-materializing.
 * 5. Present pages become a full slide: `id`/`type`/`heading` from the page
 *    spec (never the content record — see step 2), plus whichever of
 *    {@link PageContent}'s seven fields the content record actually set.
 *    `beat` now carries straight into the IR's own `Slide.beat` field too —
 *    reached from `PageSpec`, not `PageContent` (same source as `id`/`type`/
 *    `heading`, since `beat` is spec-owned, not per-page content) — as of
 *    the P1 variety wave's task 1. Previously dropped here as a spec-only
 *    authoring anchor, `SlideSchema.beat`'s own doc comment
 *    (`../ir/index.ts`) has the full accounting of what it now does
 *    downstream. `focus` remains a spec-only authoring anchor. A filled
 *    boundary page (`cover`, `chapter`, or `ending`) carries `summary` into
 *    `subheading`, because its page file has no body-content field that can
 *    express the line after filling. A filled `content` page keeps summary
 *    spec-only, so its fill prompt does not become duplicate visible slide
 *    content.
 * 6. Top-level: `version` is always the literal `"4"` (IR's own version,
 *    unrelated to the deck spec's own `version: "1"`) — the deck spec's own
 *    `narrative` field (renamed this task from `scenario`, spec §8.1's
 *    `DeckPlan`→`DeckSpec` rename, task 2) carries across into the v4 IR's
 *    own `narrative` field, its value already in the new strategy/pacing
 *    vocabulary (vocabulary-v4 rename, task 1 — `spec/index.ts`'s own
 *    `resolveNarrative` call already validates it against that vocabulary
 *    before this function ever runs).
 *    `theme`/`filename`/`brand`/`branding`/`meta`/`seed` (step 7) carry over from the spec when
 *    present. When absent, this function omits the field from the raw
 *    object it hands to {@link PptxIRSchema} rather than re-deriving IR's
 *    own default value a second time — one default source of truth, the
 *    schema itself (e.g. `theme` omitted here becomes `{ id: "consulting" }`,
 *    exactly like a bare hand-authored IR that never mentions theme at all —
 *    not a value this function needs to know). `branding` is the same omit
 *    posture: a spec that never sets it produces an IR that never sets it,
 *    and the renderer treats that as `"cover-only"`. This function must not
 *    infer branding from narrative.
 * 7. Seed: `spec.seed` present → passed through, `generatedSeed` stays
 *    `undefined` on the result. Absent → {@link generateSeed} derives one
 *    from `filename` + the spec's own ordered page-id list (never page
 *    *content* — see that function's own doc comment for why), written to
 *    `ir.seed` *and* returned as `generatedSeed` so a CLI shell can suggest
 *    writing it back into the spec file (this function never touches disk
 *    itself).
 * 8. Idempotence: every step above is a pure function of its inputs (no
 *    randomness, no wall-clock, no reliance on unordered iteration) — two
 *    calls with structurally-equal `spec`/`pages` produce deep-equal
 *    results, `generatedSeed` included. Exercised directly by this module's
 *    test suite rather than asserted here.

 * future re-`assembleDeck` call with a different seed) to re-derive one.
 * Runs exactly once per {@link assembleDeck} call, after {@link PptxIRSchema}
 * has already produced `ir` — every input `resolveEffectiveLayoutId` needs
 * (resolved theme id, resolved narrative strategy, the final `seed`) is only
 * available on that fully-defaulted object, never on the raw pre-parse shape.
 *
 * Two cases leave a slide untouched:
 *
 * - `slide.layout` already set (the page file wrote one explicitly, `step 5`
 *   of {@link assembleDeck}'s own doc comment) — skipped without even calling
 *   the resolver. `resolveEffectiveLayoutId` would just echo a valid
 *   layout pin straight back anyway (its own explicit-pin short-circuit),
 *   but skipping the call keeps "an explicit page file value survives
 *   untouched" true by construction, not by coincidence of what the resolver
 *   happens to do with it.
 * - The resolver returns `null` — the image-cover takeover
 *   (`ImageCoverPage`'s bespoke frame, no `LAYOUT_REGISTRY` id to name, see
 *   `resolveEffectiveLayoutId`'s own doc comment). `null` has no home in
 *   `layout`'s `string | undefined` shape, and this function's job is to
 *   materialize *exactly* what the resolver already means by its return
 *   value, never invent a representation the resolver itself doesn't have.
 *
 * Every other omitted-`layout` slide gets `resolveEffectiveLayoutId`'s
 * return value spliced in — always a real `LAYOUT_REGISTRY` id for the 13
 * built-in themes (their curated pools are never empty for any slide type).
 *
 * Reads every slide off the *same* `ir` object across the whole pass, and
 * builds a fresh `slides` array instead of mutating one in place — required
 * by `resolveEffectiveLayoutId`'s own adjacent-anti-repetition fold
 * (`../svg/layout-selection.ts`'s `resolveDeckEffectiveLayoutIds`), which
 * walks the deck once against `ir.slides` exactly as given and caches by
 * `ir` object identity: feeding it a slide whose `layout` this function's
 * own earlier iteration had already overwritten would corrupt "slide i-1's
 * final effective id" into "slide i-1's materialized id" for every later
 * slide — the same value for an auto-picked neighbor, but silently wrong the
 * moment a spec pins one page's layout explicitly next to an auto-picked one
 * (the pin would then read back as slide i-1's own "effective id" a second
 * time, double-counting it as a repetition risk it was never actually a
 * candidate for).
 *
 * Round-trip note: `disassembleDeck` (below) reads whatever this function

 * recoveries are:
 *
 * - `focus` never appears on any produced {@link PageSpec} — it is a
 *   spec-only authoring anchor with no corresponding `Slide` field at all
 *   (see {@link assembleDeck} step 5's doc comment). Nothing here could
 *   recover a value that was never written anywhere. `beat` used to share
 *   this fate but no longer does (P1 variety wave, task 1): it is now a
 *   plain passthrough on both sides, exactly like `layout`/`heading` below —
 *   `assembleDeck` step 5/6 reads `pageSpec.beat` into `slide.beat`, this
 *   function reads `slide.beat` straight back below.
 * - `summary` is recovered from `subheading` for every placeholder slide and
 *   for filled boundary slides (`cover`, `chapter`, and `ending`). This
 *   reverses steps 4 and 5 without losing their visible subtitle. A filled
 *   content slide's own `subheading` remains a separate authored field. It
 *   has no {@link PageContent} field to land in, and treating it as summary
 *   would turn visible slide copy into a fill-only prompt, so it is dropped.
 *   Same for `decor`: a real `Slide` field absent from `PageContent`.
 * - `theme.style` / `theme.brand` overrides collapse to a bare theme-id
 *   string (`DeckSpecSchema.theme` has no shape for either) — only `theme.id`
 *   survives. That `theme.brand` is `ThemeSchema.brand` (`BrandConfigSchema`
 *   — `suppressFooterOnCardContent`/`suppressFooterRule`/`suppressFooterMeta`,
 *   brand-footer flags owned by the *theme*) — not to be confused with the deck-level
 *   `brand` field below, a different, unrelated schema despite the shared
 *   name.
 * - `ir.assets.images` is not part of this function's return value at all —
 *   `{ spec, pages }` has no `assets` field, and this module stays zero-fs
 *   by design (this file's own top comment), so it has no way to write an
 *   `assets/` directory itself. Any `asset_id` reference inside a copied
 *   `components`/`background` survives untouched ({@link extractPageContent}
 *   copies both as-is), but the underlying image bytes are deliberately left
 *   for the caller: the CLI shell closes that gap. `runDisassemble`
 *   (`../cli/commands.ts`) walks the *input* IR's `ir.assets.images` itself
 *   and materializes every entry into `<outDir>/assets/<id>.<ext>`
 *   (`writeDeckAssets`, `../cli/deck-dir.ts`) so a later `readDeckDir`'s
 *   `scanAssets` re-registers them exactly like any other deck-directory
 *   asset. Skipping that shell-side step is not a doc-comment nuance — it
 *   reproduces as a real bug: an image deck disassembles with every
 *   `asset_id` left dangling, then re-assembles and renders with the image
 *   silently missing.

 * Round-trip-safe despite the above, worth calling out because of that name
 * collision: the top-level `brand` field (`BrandSchema` — `logo_asset_id` /
 * `position`, the deck logo/position `Branding` reads,
 * `src/svg/branding.tsx`) is a plain passthrough on both sides
 * ({@link assembleDeck} step 6 reads `spec.brand` into `ir.brand` — this
 * function reads `ir.brand` back into `spec.brand` below) — carried through
 * unmodified, same as `narrative`/`filename`/`seed`/`branding`, never
 * synthesized or dropped.
 *
 * `layout` deserves a different kind of callout: it round-trips as plain
 * content like any other field ({@link extractPageContent} copies
 * `slide.layout` into `PageContent.layout` whenever the slide has one, no
 * special case) — but a `deck.json` produced by {@link assembleDeck} now
 * carries a `layout` on nearly every slide (W4 design decision 10's
 * materialization, see that function's own doc comment), even on pages whose
 * *original page file* never set one. Nothing on `Slide` marks which is
 * which — `layout` is just a string either way — so disassembling an
 * already-assembled `deck.json` writes every materialized pick into the
 * regenerated page file as if it had been an explicit pin all along, and a
 * later re-`assembleDeck` call skips materialization for that page from then
 * on, same as any hand-authored pin. Accepted, not a bug: `disassembleDeck`
 * is a one-time bare-IR importer into an editable project directory, not a
 * round-trip channel for `deck.json` itself. A deck project's own
 * `pages/<id>.json` files are the durable, edit-in-place artifacts —
 * `deck.json` is downstream output, and feeding it back through
 * `disassembleDeck` (instead of editing the project directory that produced
 * it) is what actually costs those pages their revision-stability
 * re-selection eligibility going forward. A real, user-visible narrowing,
 * worth knowing about here, not worth adding code to guard against for a
 * usage pattern nothing in this codebase actually exercises.
 *
 * Two structural fields are synthesized rather than copied when the source
 * slide omits them, each documented where it is generated:
 * {@link UNTITLED_HEADING} for a missing/blank `heading`, and a positional
 * `p-<1-based-ordinal>-<type>` scheme for a missing `id` (stable across
 * repeated calls on the same IR — it is a pure function of slide position
 * and type — but, unlike a spec-assigned id, *not* stable across inserting
 * or reordering slides — out of scope here, since a bare IR with no `id` at
 * all has no stabler identity to fall back to in the first place).
 *
 * That generated `p-<ordinal>-<type>` id is safe by construction as a
 * page/asset file-name segment (W5 whole-branch review finding 1, verified
 * — not just asserted — rather than also routing it through
 * `assertSafeFileSegment`, `../cli/deck-dir.ts`): `<ordinal>` is
 * `index + 1`, always a plain non-negative integer, and `<type>` is a
 * `Slide["type"]`, a closed schema enum (`"cover" | "chapter" | "content" |
 * "ending"`, `SlideSchema.type` in `../ir/index.ts`) — neither half can ever
 * contain a `/`, a `\`, or resolve to `".."`, so the joined id can't either.
 * A carried-over `slide.id` (the `??` branch's other side) has no such
 * guarantee — that is the one this function passes straight through
 * unchecked, same as every other field {@link extractPageContent} copies —
 * which is exactly why the write-time gate in `../cli/deck-dir.ts` (not this
 * function) is what actually closes the vulnerability.
