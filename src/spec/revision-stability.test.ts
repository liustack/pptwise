/**
 * Revision-stability acceptance tests (wave W4, task 2 — spec's own
 * acceptance wording: "改标题/插页不扰动其他页选型", editing a heading or
 * inserting a page must not disturb other pages' auto-selected layout).
 * `assemble.test.ts`'s own "materializes effective layouts" block covers the
 * *mechanics* of materialization (one `assembleDeck` call, does it write the
 * right thing) — this file covers the *stability* property across repeated
 * `assembleDeck` calls on an edited plan, which is the actual thing W4's
 * seed-ladder redesign (design decisions 2 + 3) and adjacent-anti-repetition
 * (design decision 4) exist to guarantee.
 *
 * All four scenarios share one 8-page fixture (`basePages`): a cover, six
 * content pages, and an ending — enough interior pages that the mid-deck
 * insertion scenario has real room on both sides of the insertion point to
 * show "the disturbance stays local," not just assert it by definition on a
 * too-small deck.
