/**
 * Chart data normalization layer (R1 evidence wave, Task T1 — roadmap
 * §6.1.2). Pure data module: no React, no rendering, no coordinates, no
 * imports from `chart-svg.tsx` (that file imports FROM this one, not the
 * other way — wired in Task T2). This module exists to fix two confirmed
 * multi-series defects without touching a single pixel:
 *
 *  - `chart-svg.tsx`'s `renderBar` reads only `series[0]?.data` — every
 *    other series is silently dropped from the drawn output (though its
 *    values already leak into the domain's `max`, since that line's own
 *    `series.flatMap(...)` already scans every series — see this module's
 *    "single-series identity" doc block below for why that particular
 *    asymmetry doesn't affect single-series callers).
 *  - `renderLine` computes a *per-series* max (`Math.max(...s.data.map(...),
 *    1)` inside its own `series.map` callback) — multi-series lines have no
 *    shared comparison scale, so two series' magnitudes aren't visually
 *    comparable.
 *
 * `buildChartModel` below is the single entry point: category union,
 * per-series aligned value arrays, a shared value domain, a duplicate-x
 * report, and a legend entry list. Every other export is a small, focused
 * piece of that (a key builder, a domain-derived helper) kept public
 * because Task T2 (and `ir-quality.ts`'s future duplicate-category warning)
 * needs it directly, not because this module wants a wide surface.
 *
 * **Byte-compat contract (Global Constraint 1)**: a single positive series
 * (no negative values, one series only) must produce a domain numerically
 * identical to what `renderBar`/`renderLine` compute today. See
 * `chart-model.test.ts`'s "single-series identity" suite for the exact
 * source lines replicated and why the replication is exact, not
 * approximate.

// ── category keys ──

/**
 * Opaque, stable identity for one chart x value. Two x's are the "same
 * category" iff they produce the same key.
 *
 * Encodes both the value and its original JS type: `x: "1"` (string) and
 * `x: 1` (number) are legal sibling inputs under the IR schema
 * (`src/ir/components/chart.ts`'s `z.union([z.string(), z.number()])`) and
 * must NOT collapse into one category — a deck author who mixes numeric
 * codes and free-text labels across series would otherwise see their data
 * silently merged. The type tag is a fixed prefix (`"s:"` / `"n:"`) that the
 * raw value can never reproduce across the type boundary — a string can
 * begin with literally any text, including `"n:5"`, but `categoryKeyOf("n:5")`
 * still differs from `categoryKeyOf(5)` (`"s:n:5"` vs `"n:5"`) because the
 * prefix each starts with is what's compared, not a substring search.
 *
 * `-0` and `0` intentionally collapse to the same key (`String(-0) ===
 * "0"`) — no chart author distinguishes negative zero as its own category.

 * actually draw. A dropped duplicate's value never reaches this function,
 * so it can never inflate or shrink the domain (see `chart-model.test.ts`'s
 * "a dropped duplicate's value does not inflate the domain" case).
 *
 * `max` is unconditionally floored at `1` — not only when the domain would
 * otherwise be degenerate. This isn't a simplification of "expand only
 * when needed"; it's an exact replication of the current renderers' own
 * `Math.max(...values, 1)` formula (`chart-svg.tsx` `renderBar`/`renderLine`,
 * see `chart-model.test.ts`'s cited lines), which floors the divisor at 1
 * even when the real max is a positive value below 1 (e.g. a series of
 * `[0.5, 0.3]` shares — real max 0.5, but the renderer already divides by
 * 1 today, not 0.5). Diverging from that here would silently rescale every
 * sub-1-max single-series chart the moment Task T2 wires this in.
 *
 * `min` is `Math.min(0, ...values)` — never floored — so an all-negative
 * or mixed-sign input still gets its true low edge. Because `max`'s floor
 * is unconditional, `max >= 1 > 0 >= min` always holds: `[min, max]` can

 * a shared value domain, a duplicate-x report, and a legend entry list.
 *
 * Pure function of its input — same `series` (by value, not by reference)
 * always produces a deep-equal `ChartModel`, and `series` is never mutated.
 * Ordering is fully determined by input order (series order, then each
 * series' own `data` order); the one internal `Map` (`categoryIndexByKey`)
 * is only ever inserted into in that same deterministic order and iterated
 * via a parallel `categories` array, not via `Map` iteration, so there is
 * no reliance on `Map`/object key reordering hazards (see `categoryKeyOf`'s
 * doc comment — even if iterated directly, a `Map`'s insertion order is
 * spec-guaranteed, unlike a plain object's integer-like string keys).
 *
 * Rules implemented (roadmap §6.1.2):
 * 1. **Category union** — the first series' x order establishes the
 *    category order; each later series appends only the x's it introduces
 *    that no earlier series (or its own earlier points) already did, in
 *    that series' own encounter order.
 * 2. **Duplicate x within one series** — the first occurrence's value is
 *    kept (matches `chart-svg.tsx`'s current positional-walk render
 *    semantics); every later occurrence in that same series is dropped
 *    from `AlignedSeries.values` and reported in `duplicates`.
 * 3. **Shared domain** — one `[min, max]` across every series' kept values,
 *    always including zero; see {@link computeChartDomain}'s own doc
 *    comment for the exact formula and its byte-compat rationale.
 * 4. **Legend** — one entry per input series, in input order; see
 *    {@link LegendEntry}'s doc comment for the render-time boundary this
 *    deliberately stays on the near side of.
