/**
 * Porter's Five Forces cross panel (structure-components wave 2,
 * task 1) — `rivalry` is the center panel (competitive rivalry, the model's
 * own namesake force), the other four surround it in the conventional
 * textbook arrangement (new entrants above, suppliers left, buyers right,
 * substitutes below). Connectors were removed (gallery review r2 D19 / E0:
 * a spoke line is an emphasis bar). Face color separates the five panels. A
 * full-body component (`FULL_BODY_TYPES`, `component-traits.ts`) — the only
 * component `svg-content.tsx` ever hands this to fills the whole content
 * rect, no sibling components on the same slide (`checkFullBodyExclusivity`,
 * `api.ts`).
 *
 * **Geometry is a 3×3 cross grid, engine-derived, never modeled**: three
 * columns (`left`/`center`/`right`, `SIDE_COL_RATIO` splits the width) by
 * three rows whose heights are each panel's own real fitted-content height
 * (`crossGeom`, the same "measure every cell's natural content, take the
 * governing max" idiom `bmc.tsx`'s `naturalBandHeights` already established)
 * — the four corner cells are simply never populated.
 *
 * **Undersized-box shrink is real here too** (`bmc.tsx`'s own bench-driven
 * fix-round defect F, ported proactively rather than rediscovered): a
 * full-body component gets the layout's *fixed* content-rect height
 * verbatim (`svg-content.tsx`), never a box sized to its own `measure()`
 * value, and this component's schema-max content (5 items in every one of
 * the 5 panels) can exceed even the narrowest curated content rect —
 * confirmed empirically the same way bmc's own defect was (this file's
 * dedicated 13-theme schema-max sweep in `../audit/full-matrix-
 * contrast.test.ts` failed with bottom-band v-overflow/page-overflow
 * findings on every theme before this fix, verified during this task's own
 * red-first pass). `render` extends `bmc.tsx`'s two-stage fix to three,
 * cheapest concession first:
 *
 * 1. **Air** (`airScale`, 2026-08-20): the two header gaps slide from their
 *    comfortable values toward their `_TIGHT` ones, by exactly as much as
 *    `box.h` is short by and no more. Air carries no legibility obligation,
 *    so it is what a tight box spends first — see `GAP_LABEL_MARKER_TIGHT`.
 * 2. **Type** (`fontScale` < 1, floored at `MIN_FONT_SCALE`): still short
 *    once the air is gone, so every panel's font size and vertical rhythm
 *    shrink uniformly before geometry is derived.
 * 3. **Stretch** (`growScale` >= 1, `swot.tsx`/`bmc.tsx`'s uncapped idiom):
 *    grows the row bands when `box.h` instead exceeds the natural total.
 *
 * Stages 1-2 and stage 3 never engage at once (`box.h` is either short of
 * natural, long, or exactly natural). Together they absorb the dedicated
 * 13-theme schema-max sweep cleanly (verified: zero findings,
 * "pest/five_forces schema-max content" describe block) — and with room to
 * spare that the pre-2026-08-20 build did not have, since that sweep used
 * to clear `MIN_FONT_SCALE`'s floor by one percent and now clears it on air
 * alone. The one compound edge case still not fully absorbed — the same
 * residual `bmc.tsx`'s own header already names — is schema-max content
 * *and* a heading long enough to force a 2-line wrap *and* the narrowest
 * curated layout, all three at once (verified: a synthetic 55-char heading
 * shrinks `narrow-column`'s content rect to 347px against a 425px floored
 * natural, reintroducing a bottom-band v-overflow that neither air nor the
 * font-scale floor can close; a realistic short heading does not reach it).
 * Out of this task's own scope, same discipline as bmc's residual —
 * documented, not chased.
 *
 * **Intensity marker** (task 1 scope item 2): a deterministic 3-dot meter —
 * filled-dot count = 1 (low) / 2 (medium) / 3 (high) out of 3, solid fill
 * for a filled dot vs. stroke-only outline for an empty one. Distinguishing
 * filled/empty by *shape* (solid disk vs. ring), not only by color, keeps
 * the marker legible independent of hue — the same reasoning
 * `accessibleInk`'s whole existence rests on (never assume a viewer
 * resolves color the way the author's screen did). The marker paints no
 * text, so it carries no `findContrastIssues` obligation of its own — only
 * the panel's title/item text does, same as `swot.tsx`/`bmc.tsx`.
 *
 * **Panel color policy** (decision 7: theme tokens only): `rivalry`
 * (`colors.accent`, tinted slightly stronger — 0.18 vs. 0.14 — to read as
 * the visual hub) / `new_entrants` (`colors.primary`) / `supplier_power`
 * (`colors.muted`) / `buyer_power` (`mixHex(primary, accent, 0.5)`) /
 * `substitutes` (`mixHex(accent, muted, 0.5)`) — five distinct combinations
 * from three semantic tokens, the same "no 4th/5th token exists, blend
 * instead of inventing a hardcoded color" constraint `swot.tsx`'s
 * `badgeFill` already documents. Every title/item ink routes through
 * `accessibleInk` against its own panel's real fill — see the dedicated
 * 13-theme sweep in `../audit/full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`
 * ("pest/five_forces tinted-panel contrast").

/**
 * Air between the panel's title and the intensity dots under it, and
 * between that header block and the item list.
 *
 * Both were raised on 2026-08-15 after the visual review found the dots
 * reading as if they were stuck to the underside of the title ("圆点跟文本
 * 挤在一起…没有呼吸感") in both Chinese and English. The dot meter is a
 * separate statement from the title, not a diacritic on it, so it needs
 * enough room to read as its own line — and the header as a whole needs to
 * separate from the items more than it separates internally, or the three
 * elements read as one undifferentiated block.
 *
 * **Raised a second time on 2026-08-20** — the same complaint came back in
 * review round 3, and re-measuring showed the 2026-08-15 pass had not moved
 * the render at all in the direction it claimed. Two reasons, both now
 * fixed:
 *
 * 1. The numbers were too small to begin with. Measured on the real
 *    `component--five-forces--zh` page (browser `getBBox`, not estimates),
 *    title-to-dot air was 5.8px against a panel that pads itself 10px at
 *    the top — the dots read as belonging to the title's own line.
 * 2. `renderPanel` then spent 2px of `GAP_LABEL_MARKER` back by drawing the
 *    marker at `gapLabelMarker - markerDotR / 2`, i.e. half a dot higher
 *    than the band `panelLayout` reserves for it. So the drawn air was
 *    never the declared air, and the marker overhung the top of its own
 *    reserved band by `markerDotR / 2` while leaving that much slack at the
 *    bottom. The subtraction is gone: the marker's top now sits exactly
 *    `gapLabelMarker` below the title baseline, which is what `contentH`
 *    has always been budgeting for.
 *
 * These two constants are the vertical rhythm's only free variables, so
 * they are also what `five-forces.test.tsx`'s "header rhythm" assertions
 * pin — a panel's declared header band must match its drawn one, and the
 * header must separate from the items by more than it separates
 * internally. Raising these raises `measure()` by 10px per intensity-
 * carrying panel (5 for the marker band, 5 for the header/items gap),
 * i.e. +30px of natural component height for the three-row cross.
 *
 * That +30 is not free, which is what `_TIGHT` below is for.

/**
 * The same two gaps, at the smallest values this component is willing to
 * draw them — `render`'s undersized-box path collapses toward these before
 * it touches type size.
 *
 * They are the pre-2026-08-20 values verbatim, which is the point: this
 * component shipped at 11/13 for five days and the complaint against them
 * was that they read cramped, not that they read broken. Cramped is the
 * correct answer for a box that cannot afford comfortable.
 *
 * **Why air gives before type does.** The raise above cost real headroom
 * on the one fixture that was already at the edge: the 13-theme schema-max
 * sweep (`../audit/full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`, 5 items in all 5 panels
 * on `narrow-column`, the narrowest curated content layout) fits its
 * component into a 410px rect. At 11/13 the natural total was 512.5, so it
 * needed a `fontScale` of 0.800 — clearing `MIN_FONT_SCALE`'s 0.792 floor
 * by one percent. At 16/18 the natural total is 542.5 and the required
 * scale is 0.756, i.e. under the floor, so the floor clamps and 15.2px of
 * item text spills past the content rect on every one of the 17 themes.
 *
 * Shrinking type further is the wrong way to buy that back: `padTop`,
 * `padBottom` and these two gaps are the only vertical terms carrying no
 * legibility obligation at all, while `MIN_FONT_SCALE` exists precisely to
 * say how small item text is allowed to get. So the shrink path spends air
 * first and type second (`render`), and these constants are how far the
 * air is allowed to be spent. A box that is short by less than the
 * comfort span gets the air scaled part-way rather than dropped to the
 * floor, so there is no cliff at exactly-natural height.
