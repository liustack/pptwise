   * fraction of this repo's component-level tests construct a `ComponentCtx`
   * object literal directly rather than through `buildCtx` (paragraph/kpi/

   * Sourced from a single seam: `full-slide-svg.tsx`'s `buildCtx` resolves

   * Required, unlike `defaultBg` above — a deliberate divergence from that
   * field's precedent, not an inconsistency: `defaultBg` is an optional
   * contrast *enhancement* with a safe same-family fallback baked into

   * when only one call site remembered it, and would mask a broken wiring
   * path (a hand-built ctx missing this field) as a plausible-looking
   * render instead of a compile error. Requiring it pushes that failure to
   * compile time everywhere a `ComponentCtx` is built by hand — mostly
   * this repo's component-level tests. `buildCtx` itself keeps its own
   * corresponding parameter optional (defaults to
   * `PACING_BUDGETS.balanced.bodyBaselinePx`), so the many
   * `buildCtx(...)`-calling layout tests that don't care about
   * body-text sizing are unaffected — only the smaller set of tests that
   * construct a `ComponentCtx` object literal directly needed a value
   * added (W4 task 3 re-pin round).
