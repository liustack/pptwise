 * already relies on.
 *
 * One-line rationale per member, grounded in each layout's own body
 * comment (`CONTENT_LAYOUT_DEFS`, `svg/layouts/registry.ts`) rather than its
 * name alone:
 *
 * - **anchor** (one bold, high-impact statement):
 *   - `stacked-poster` — its non-degrade path routes component 1 into a
 *     dedicated `hero` slot (capacity 1): poster-scale single-subject
 *     treatment, the most visually loud body geometry in the content pool.
 *   - `split-band` (content-layout expansion wave, task T3 —
 *     `.issues/2026-07-26-content-archetypes/plan.md`) — its full-bleed
 *     `header` band *is* the heading treatment (a filled `colors.primary`
 *     rect spanning the entire page width, not inset to the usual x=96..
 *     1184 content margins). The retired `banner-heading` assertion banner
 *     used to share this "banner rect is the heading" register, inset to
 *     those margins. `split-band` stays as the remaining assertion-band
 *     grammar. (The retired `side-highlight` panel used to share this
 *     "loud opaque color block" register beside the body.)
 * - **dense** (many discrete items, high information density):
 *   - `bento-panel` — the only content layout whose `body` capacity is 6
 *     (every other is 4): a multi-cell grid sized to hold the most, not the
 *     boldest.
 *   - `two-column` — splits the body into two narrower columns running in
 *     parallel, doubling the visible item count over a single stack at the
 *     same height budget.
 *   - `rail-numbered` — a numbered progress rail ("{chapter}.{n}") is
 *     itself a sequential-breakdown signal, the layout that most invites a
 *     long enumerated list rather than one hero item.
 *   - `asymmetric-triptych` (P1 variety wave, task 4) — three independently
 *     filled regions (a lead column plus two framed secondary panels), the
 *     pool's highest *structural* region count after bento-panel's 6-cell
 *     grid — and, addressing the T1 handoff's reviewer note that
 *     `two-column`/`rail-numbered` read as visually thin on a
 *     single-component page, a 3-component page still frames the filled
 *     TOP/BOTTOM panels. A 1-component page collapses like `two-column`
 *     at n<2: the lead takes the full body width, and empty slots never
 *     draw a frame (see the layout file's own composition-sketch header).
 * - **breathing** (generous whitespace, one unhurried flow):
 *   - `narrow-column` — the narrowest body column in the pool, paired with
 *     a large muted page-number watermark filling the right gutter: spacious
 *     by construction, not by content choice.
 *   - `quiet-frame` (P1 variety wave, task 4) — a whitespace-led centered
 *     composition (symmetric 200px margins, no watermark, no side panel):
 *     the pool's second `breathing` member, closing the single-member gap
 *     the T1 handoff flagged (a lone tendency-set member is over-sensitive
 *     to the max-composition agreement case — any strategy that also favors
 *     that one id gets a "free" corroboration with nothing else to spread
 *     across).
 *     Gallery r2 D10 retired `image-lead-split` (an unconditional 60/40
 *     split that left one column vacant on 1-component pages). `breathing`
 *     is two members again.
 *
 * `tone-adaptive-content` — the pool's "万金油" (already strategy-neutral by
 * `layoutTendencies`' own convention) — is deliberately absent from every
 * set here too, for the same reason: it is the one content layout meant

 * `1`, and `strategyWeight` is always `>= 1`
 * (`TENDENCY_WEIGHT`/`BASE_WEIGHT`), so `Math.max(strategyWeight, 1)` always

 * corroborates that id rather than compounding into a runaway share. See
 * `weightOf` below.
 *
 * **Hard boundary unaffected**: `weightOf` is only ever invoked by
 * `weightedPickBySeed` over `pool` (built from `layouts[slideType]` before

 * that pool is simply never passed to `weightOf` at all, so it can never
 * inflate any real candidate's weight. That silent no-op is precisely why
 * declaring one is a theme-author mistake, not a legal edge case —
 * `registerTheme` (`../themes/definitions.ts`) rejects it at registration
 * time, and `definitions.test.ts` sweeps the 13 builtins for the same
 * mistake, so this module itself never needs to defend against it.
 *
 * **Undeclared theme = byte-identical to before this layer existed**: an
 * omitted `layoutTendencies` (the whole field, or just this slide type's own

/**
 * Resolve the layout registry id for one page-type slot (spec §6 steps

 * explicit pin bypasses `theme.layouts` curation, `narrativesOnly`, and
 * narrative weighting unconditionally, it is not a soft preference confined
 * to the curated family). Otherwise:
 *
 * 1. **theme.layouts curation** (step 3, already the caller's job — this
 *    function just reads `layouts[slideType]` as the starting pool).
 * 2. **`narrativesOnly` hard filter** (step 4's rare constraint,
 *    {@link filterByNarrativesOnly}): drop any candidate whose allowlist is
 *    set and excludes the resolved `strategy`. An empty result after this
 *    step folds into the same `null` defensive fallback as an empty curated
 *    pool (unreachable for the 13 built-in themes today — no built-in
 *    layout sets `narrativesOnly` yet).
 * 3. **narrative soft weighting** (step 4's ×3/×1, `TENDENCY_WEIGHT`/
 *    `BASE_WEIGHT` above, sourced per slide type by `tendencyIdsFor` —
 *    content reads `layoutTendencies`, cover/chapter/ending each read their

 *    theme soft weighting** (theme-structure wave task T1's own layer, the
 *    caller-resolved `themeTendencies` slice of `ThemeDefinition.layoutTendencies`
 *    — `../themes/definitions.ts`, reusing `TENDENCY_WEIGHT`/`BASE_WEIGHT`,
 *    no third constant pair) — all three combined via `Math.max`, not
 *    multiplication, per `BEAT_TENDENCY_WEIGHT`'s own doc comment: every
 *    layer agreeing on one id corroborates that id, it never compounds the
 *    pull. `BEAT_TENDENCIES` only ever names content ids, so beat stays a
 *    structural no-op for cover/chapter/ending regardless of slide type —
 *    beat never weights identity pages, while a theme's own tendency is (by
 *    design decision 2) the one signal that reaches those three page types
 *    at all. An omitted `beat` and/or an omitted `themeTendencies` each
 *    contribute an implicit weight of 1 for every candidate, which `max`
 *    never lets exceed the strategy-only weight, so a slide type/theme pair
 *    that declares neither resolves to exactly the pre-existing
 *    strategy-only weight, byte-identical to before either layer existed)
 *    **+ weighted seed sampling** (step 5,
 *    `weightedPickBySeed` — salt is `` `${slideType}-archetype:${pageKey}` ``,
 *    W4 design decision 2: `pageKey` is the caller-resolved `slide.id ??
 *    String(index)`, replacing the retired same-type ordinal rotation so a
 *    mid-deck insert/reorder no longer reshuffles every other page's pick).
 * 4. **Adjacent anti-repetition** (W4 design decision 4, local
 *    post-process): if the step-3 pick equals `previousEffectiveLayoutId`
 *    (slide i-1's own final resolved id, any slide type — supplied by the
 *    caller, never re-derived here) and the pool has more than one member,
 *    redraw once against the same salt with that id removed (deterministic
 *    runner-up). A pool of exactly 1 never redraws — there is no
 *    alternative — and this step never runs for an explicit pin (returned
 *    already, above) or the first slide (`previousEffectiveLayoutId` is
 *    `null` there, which no real layout id ever equals).
 *
 * Returns `null` only for the allowed-set-empty defensive fallback
 * (unreachable for the 13 built-in themes — every one has a non-empty
 * allowed set for all four slide types — kept for future/custom themes,
 * same "total function, never crash" posture as `resolveThemeId`).
 *
 * Pulled out of `full-slide-svg.tsx`'s old private `resolvePageLayout` (W3 task

 *
 * Trusts `slide === ir.slides[index]` rather than re-verifying it (W4 fix
 * round, Minor M1): every real call site (render's `FullSlideSvg`,
 * `ir-quality.ts`'s per-slide loop, every test in this repo) already
 * satisfies that invariant, and this function isn't part of the public SDK
 * barrel (`src/index.ts`) an external caller could violate it through. An
 * earlier version carried a defensive fallback branch that re-derived the
 * answer via `resolveOneEffectiveLayoutId` when the equality check failed —
 * dead code (zero coverage, zero real trigger) that risked becoming a
 * second, silently-drifting selection-logic copy of its own, which is
 * exactly what this module's own file header warns against. `slide` stays
 * in the signature for call-site stability even though the body no longer
 * reads it.
