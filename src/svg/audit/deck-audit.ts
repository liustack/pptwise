 * exact extrema (derivative roots for curves, endpoint -> center
 * parameterization for arcs — see `pathBoundingBoxByGrammar`'s own doc

 * function's bbox, never the path's exact outline, and the one large
 * opaque non-decor `<path>` background this renderer draws
 * (`cover-split-diagonal.tsx`'s straight-edged colour panel) has vertices
 * that *are* its extremes, so the bbox is exact there regardless.
 *
 * Falls back to `pathBoundingBoxByTokenMinMax` (the pre-fix behavior) only
 * for a `d` string the grammar walk can't parse — genuinely malformed
 * input, not any path this renderer itself emits — see that function's own
 * doc comment. `motif-campaign-motif.tsx`'s crayon-stroke decor paths stay
 * out of scope for a different, unrelated reason: `findContrastIssues`'s

 *

 * center is the `M` point itself, written directly — no trig needed to
 * recover it. `x1,y1`/`x2,y2` are exact points on the circle at the
 * sector's start/end angle, read back via `atan2` for the angular span.
 * `ri` is always `0` — a pie slice has no hole.
 *
 * Donut idiom (`M ox1 oy1 A r r 0 large 1 ox2 oy2 L ix1 iy1 A ri ri 0 large
 * 0 ix2 iy2 Z`, 23 tokens): unlike the pie, the center is never written to
 * `d` directly, only two arc endpoints per angle (outer radius `r`, inner
 * radius `ri`). `ox1,oy1` (outer point, start angle) and `ix2,iy2` (inner
 * point, same start angle — the point `Z` closes back to `ox1,oy1`
 * through) both lie on the same ray from the center, so the center solves
 * from the one linear relationship `outer = center + r·dir`,
 * `inner = center + ri·dir` (same `dir`) satisfy:
 * `center = (r·inner − ri·outer) / (r − ri)` — exact, never degenerate
 * here since `DONUT_HOLE_RATIO < 1` keeps `r ≠ ri` for any positive outer
 * radius. Cross-checked against the *other* pair (`ix1,iy1`/`ox2,oy2`, end
 * angle) before trusting the recovered center — a mismatch means this
 * wasn't really `renderDonut`'s own idiom (or the token match was a false
 * positive on some unrelated 23-token path), so it falls back to the bbox
 * rather than trust a possibly-wrong center.
 *
 * A zero-share category (`d.y === 0`, unfiltered by `renderDonut`/
 * `renderPie` — a real, reachable shape, not hypothetical) and a 100%-share
 * category are both geometrically degenerate the same way: `startA === endA`
 * either 0 or a full turn apart, so their start/end points coincide and
 * `atan2` alone can't tell "no sweep at all" from "swept a full circle"
 * apart — both round-trip to the same coordinates. The renderer's own
 * `large-arc-flag` (`endA - startA > π ? 1 : 0`) is exactly the missing bit:
 * `0` means no sweep happened (`span = 0`, a real but visually invisible
 * sliver — correctly contains nothing), `1` means a full turn did (a single
 * 100%-share category, `span = 2π` — correctly contains the whole ring/disk).
 *
 * **Geometric round-trip, not just token shape (post-review hardening):**
 * matching the token *shape* alone is falsifiable — a hand-authored `d`
 * (an unrelated icon, say) can satisfy the same 15/23-token grammar with
 * numbers that don't actually describe a circle, e.g. an `L`/`A` endpoint
 * nowhere near the claimed radius from the claimed center. Silently
 * accepting that would parse a *wrong* sector and could flip a real
 * `findContrastIssues` verdict rather than just missing a precision
 * upgrade. So every point this function reads off the path (`x1,y1`/
 * `x2,y2` for a pie, all four outer/inner points for a donut) is checked
 * against its own claimed radius from the resolved center within
 * `RADIUS_ROUNDTRIP_EPS` — a genuine `renderDonut`/`renderPie` wedge always
 * round-trips exactly (the points *are* `cx + r·cos(θ), cy + r·sin(θ)` by
 * construction), so this only ever *rejects* a token-shape near-miss, never
 * a real one. The large-arc-flag is checked the same way: a genuine wedge's
 * flag always agrees with whether its own (non-degenerate) span exceeds π
 * (`renderPie`/`renderDonut`'s own `endA - startA > Math.PI ? 1 : 0`), so a
 * flag that disagrees with the span its own endpoints imply is rejected
 * too, independent of the radius check (it catches a different failure
 * mode — same-circle points with a mismatched sweep/magnitude flag).
 * Reject-only: this hardening never makes a previously-rejected `d` newly
 * accepted, so it never turns a correct AABB attribution into a wrong
 * sector one — only ever the other direction.

 *
 * Background is resolved from the rendered geometry itself, not from theme
 * tokens — a first design (theme `defaultBackgrounds`/`colors.bg`, see the

 * `cover-left-anchor.tsx` and `content-banner-heading.tsx` both paint an

 * real, intentional local backgrounds no theme-token lookup captures, since
 * `primary` isn't `bg`/`surface`/`panel` and isn't tonally related to them
 * (it's a brand accent, deliberately *not* close to the page background).
 * SVG has no z-index — paint order is exactly document order — so this walk
 * mirrors that directly: every opaque-enough `<rect>`/`<circle>`/`<ellipse>`/
 * `<path>`/`<polygon>` (plus `<image>`, floor-gated — see its own branch
 * below) gets recorded, in document order, as a `PaintedShape`; a text
 * element's effective background is whichever recorded shape (searched
 * most-recent-first, i.e. topmost in paint order) actually *contains* its
 * position — an exact ellipse test for `<circle>`/`<ellipse>`, a bounding-box
 * test for the other four (see
 * `rectShape`/`ellipseShape`/`pathBoundingBox`/`polygonBoundingBox`).
 * This one mechanism covers the page background (`background.tsx` always
 * paints first), a gradient's individual bands (each is its own shape — more
 * precise than any single midpoint), local panels/cards/banners (the
 * bento-card/kpi/icon-card/banner-heading shell `<rect>`s), a self-painted
 * badge/chip a text glyph sits directly on top of (`rail-numbered`'s "1.1"
 * badge, `steps`' numbered circle — see `MIN_BG_REGION_AREA`'s own doc
 * comment for the false-positive family this fixes), and an asset-background
 * scrim opaque enough to trust (`MIN_BG_OPACITY`) — while a bare photo
 * `<image>` with no (or too-faint) scrim correctly resolves to "unknown"
 * (`fill: null`) rather than a guess, and text over it is skipped.
 *
 * **Gradient fills route the same way (task R3):** a shape whose `fill` is a
 * gradient reference (`url(#...)`, e.g. `chart-svg.tsx`'s bar fills) used to
 * fail the registration gate outright — neither a resolvable solid color nor
 * `<image>`'s explicit `fill: null` path, so it simply never became a
 * `PaintedShape` at all, and a text element painted over it silently
 * resolved against whatever *solid* shape happened to sit underneath
 * instead: a real misattribution, not a skip — worse than the `<image>`
 * blind spot above, which at least degrades to a checkable "unknown".
 * `resolveCandidateFill` closes this: a `url(...)` fill now registers
 * exactly like a bare `<image>` does — `fill: null`, both in
 * `paintedShapes` and, area-floor permitting, in `regions` — reusing the
 * identical `__collectImageBackedTextRuns` -> `pixel-audit.ts`
 * worst-case-pixel-sample fallback rather than inventing a second,
 * gradient-specific color approximation (which stop, at which offset, would
 * even be the "representative" one?). The `<g data-decor>` exclusion below
 * applies identically regardless of fill kind — a decor-layer gradient (e.g.
 * the tech theme's `constellation-motif` background field) was already
 * excluded from candidacy before this fix and still is; this routing change
 * only ever affects a *content-layer* gradient shape, since decoration never
 * reaches the fill check at all (see the exclusion's own boolean guard).
 *
 * **`<polygon>` joins the same registration gate (sweep2 T4):** R3 above
 * widened `resolveCandidateFill`'s reach for `rect`/`path`/`circle`/
 * `ellipse`, but `<polygon>` never dispatched to any registration branch at
 * all — a live gap, not a hypothetical one: `renderLine`'s per-series
 * area-under-curve fill (`chart-svg.tsx`, a `<polygon>` filled with its own
 * `url(#...)` gradient) was silently invisible to this walk, so text placed
 * over that area misattributed to whatever solid shape happened to sit
 * underneath, exactly the R3 defect reopened for one more tag. `<polygon>`
 * now runs through the identical `resolveCandidateFill`/opaque-enough/
 * `data-decor` gating as `rect`/`path` — solid hex registers normally,
 * `url(...)` registers `fill: null` and defers to pixel-audit — with
 * `polygonBoundingBox` standing in for `pathBoundingBox`'s bbox.
 *
 * **Bench-driven fix round (defect A):** this `PaintedShape` walk is
 * *unrestricted* by `MIN_BG_REGION_AREA` — that constant now only filters
 * the separate, page-level `regions`/`BgRegion` table (unchanged, see its own
 * doc comment) `__collectBgRegions` exposes. The two used to be the same
 * table, which is exactly the bug: a badge/chip small enough to correctly
 * *not* count as a page background is still unambiguously the real, sole
 * background of whatever text is painted directly on top of it, and gating
 * attribution by page-level area silently fell through to whatever larger
 * shape happened to sit underneath instead (the page background, a card
 * shell) — checking real text against a color it was never actually
 * rendered on. `<image>` is deliberately not extended past its existing
 * area floor for attribution (see its own branch's comment) — this
 * renderer never emits a small inline `<image>`, only large photo
 * backgrounds, so there is no real small-image case to design against, and
 * an unfloored "unknown, skip" candidate would only ever shrink coverage,
 * never fix a misattribution.
 *
 * One more gate sits on top of the shape model above, for anything inside a
 * `<g data-decor>` subtree (`full-slide-svg.tsx`'s exact wrapper around
 * `themeDef.motif`'s output — verified there, not assumed). Decoration is
 * layered *over* the real background, not a stand-in for it, so it never
 * joins the page-level `regions` table at all. For *attribution* it used to
 * be excluded on the same blanket terms, which was half right and half a
 * lie — see the two paragraphs below. Implemented as a boolean threaded
 * through `visit`'s recursion (once a `data-decor` ancestor is entered it
 * stays true for the whole subtree) rather than a string/regex pre-pass on
 * `markup` — this function already fully parses to DOM, and regex-stripping
 * a `<g>...</g>` span is unsound the moment the subtree nests further `<g>`
 * elements of its own (every motif does), which would truncate at the first
 * nested `</g>` instead of the matching one. `findOverlapIssues` needs no
 * equivalent gate (decoration never carries `data-audit-box`), but this walk
 * sees every `<rect>`/`<circle>`/`<ellipse>`/`<image>`/`<path>`/`<polygon>`
 * regardless of what drew it, so it has to be explicit here.
 *
 * **Decoration participates by shape, not by layer
 * (`fix/decor-contrast-attribution`).** The blanket attribution exclusion
 * was written for a real problem: nothing in this renderer's motif
 * discipline stops a motif from drawing large, opaque-enough shapes, and
 * `motif-campaign-motif.tsx`'s crayon strokes are exactly that (each
 * stroke's core-density bucket alone renders at >=0.64 effective opacity
 * across every call site in that file, comfortably clear of
 * `MIN_BG_OPACITY`). Those are `<path>`s, registered by their
 * `pathBoundingBox` — a box far larger than the stroke — so letting them
 * attribute would convict text that is nowhere near the ink. But the same
 * blanket rule also hid shapes whose registered geometry *is* their
 * outline. The ink theme's motif signs off with a 32px vermilion seal
 * (`<rect fill="#C3272B">`); the tone-adaptive-header cover paints its date
 * line straight across it. Real contrast: 1.07:1. What this walk reported
 * before the fix: 5.44:1, measured against the page background the seal
 * completely covers — not a missing check but a wrong answer, which is
 * worse. Same shape in tech (1.70:1 on a corner-ornament square) and
 * consulting (3.26:1). So the gate is now
 * `registersExactOutline(tag) && !hasUnmodelledTransform(...)`:
 * `rect`/`circle`/`ellipse` under a transform this walk actually models
 * join attribution, `path`/`polygon` and anything rotated/skewed stay out.
 * See both helpers' own doc comments for the criterion and its evidence.

 * Collect every "leaf" `data-audit-box` region on the page — one with no

 * inferred from geometry directly owned by that box (not crossing into a

 *
 * `data-audit-box` only ever carries `x,y,w` (verified across every emitter
 * in `src/svg`: `svg-content.tsx` and every card/list component) — never a
 * height, because the existing protocol only ever needed width, for the
 * h-overflow check it was built for. This walk reconstructs height the same
 * way the *overflow* auditor reconstructs a text's vertical extent: from
 * whatever geometry is actually drawn inside the box — a background/icon
 * shape's own explicit size when there is one, the rendered text's
 * font-metrics otherwise. In practice every card-shaped component
 * (kpi/icon_cards/steps/row_cards/verdict_banner) draws its own full-size
 * background `<rect>` as the first thing inside its box, so that rect's
 * `height` dominates and gives an exact answer; text-only components
 * (bullets/paragraph) have no such rect, so the union of their text spans is
 * what's found instead.
 *
 * Width also grows past that declared `w` floor (borrow-wave Task 4,
 * inventory-first): each `<text>` leaf widens its scope's `x`/`w` to the
 * union of the declared span and its own estimated ink extent —
 * `measureTextUnits`, or `measureMonoTextUnits` when `isMonoFontFamily`
 * reliably reads the mono role off the rendered `font-family`, `measureTextUnits`
 * itself reading the element's real `font-weight` via `isBold()` (the same
 * mono-role and bold-weight choices `svg-audit.ts`'s own h-overflow check
 * already makes — see `isMonoFontFamily`'s derivation comment in `fonts.ts`
 * and `isBold()`'s own doc comment) — anchored by the element's own
 * `text-anchor` (start/middle/end). Widening only ever grows a box, never
 * shrinks it. See docs/contrast-system.md's "Overlap detection boundary" for
 * what this does and doesn't close.
 *
 * A container box that only wraps further per-item boxes (e.g. `SvgContent`'s
 * own box around an `icon_cards` component, which itself subdivides into one
 * `data-audit-box` per card) is explicitly excluded via `hasNestedBox` —
 * *not* inferred from "collected no geometry of its own", because that proxy
 * is wrong whenever a container *also* draws something directly alongside
 * its nested boxes (`steps.tsx`'s vertical-mode connector `<line>`s are
 * siblings-before the per-row boxes, at the same outer-box scope) — without
 * the explicit flag, that container would end up with real derived geometry
 * *and* fully spatially contain its own children, which would then compare
 * as ~100% overlapping their own parent on every single steps-vertical page.

 * (`renderSlideSvg`, the same single-source SVG the preview and exporter
 * both use) and run five check families against the rendered markup —
 * overflow/out-of-bounds (reusing `svg-audit.ts`'s existing walker
 * verbatim), low-contrast (WCAG relative luminance), overlap (pairwise
 * `data-audit-box` intersection), and content-truncated/content-dropped
 * (bench-driven fix round, defect E — reading the `data-truncated`/
 * `data-dropped` markers the render chain now stamps at its own silent
 * content-loss paths). Pure — no I/O, no Node dependency (see
 * `parseSvg`'s doc comment).
 *
 * Split out from `auditDeck` (audit-v2 phase B) so the optional pixel audit
 * (`pixels: true`, see `auditDeck`'s own doc comment) can run this exact
 * same deterministic pass first and layer pixel-contrast findings on top,
 * without duplicating the render-and-walk loop.

/**
 * The SDK entry point. Advisory, not a hard gate: `validateIr` already
 * rejects structurally invalid or over-dense decks before a caller ever
 * gets this far; this function looks for the visual problems that can still
 * slip through a valid deck at render time (an author-chosen near-background
 * text color, two components whose combined content happens to collide, a
 * card list that had to drop an item to fit). A non-empty `findings` array
 * is a prompt for a human/agent to look, not a rejection.
 *
 * Placeholder pages (`slide.placeholder === true`) are skipped — assemble's
 * stand-in for content nobody has written yet has nothing to audit, same
 * reasoning `checkIrQuality` already uses to skip them (`ir-quality.ts`).
 *
 * `auditDeck` itself never calls `installNodePlatform()`; that's the
 * caller's job (the CLI does it automatically).
 *
 * `opts.pixels` (audit-v2 phase B, spec §4.3/§11.7) opts into the optional
 * pixel-level contrast audit over image-backed text (`../svg/audit/pixel-audit.ts`)
 * — overloaded so the far more common omitted/`false` case keeps returning
 * a plain, synchronous `AuditReport` (spec §11.7's "语义层": the default
 * audit stays pure TS with zero added latency or Promise-wrapping), while
 * `pixels: true` returns a `Promise<AuditReport>` that resolves once the
 * rasterization pass completes. A caller holding a non-literal
 * `{ pixels: someBoolean }` won't match either overload directly (TypeScript
 * can't narrow it to one specific branch) — branch on the boolean first and
 * call this function with a literal in each arm, e.g. `opts.pixels ? await
 * auditDeck(ir, { pixels: true }) : auditDeck(ir)` (`cli/commands.ts`'s
 * `runAudit` does exactly this).

 * comment on why `deck-audit.ts` keeps a second path tokenizer rather than
 * import one from `src/pptx`: "layering stays one-directional") argues for
 * avoiding one on principle rather than relying on that safety. The lazy
