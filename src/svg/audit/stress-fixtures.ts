 * the theme's own identical worst-case downstream Y (only `lines.length`
 * and the nominal `lineHeight` matter once fontSize stops shrinking — the
 * exact split point between the two lines does not), so any prefix in that
 * range is equally "worst case", not just this one. The other four themes
 * (tech/custom/creative/magazine) anchor their Ending's
 * *last* heading line to a fixed baseline regardless of line count (see
 * each template's own "Last-line-anchored" comment), so unlike the two

  // doc comment has the full character-concentration rationale. Five of

  // keep every component's box width the realistic single-component case,
  // not a confound from an unrelated sibling squeeze.
  //
  // `bmc`'s own title text (`BLOCK_LABELS`, `bmc.tsx`) is a fixed constant,
  // not part of the IR schema (`key_partners` etc. control each cell's
  // *items* only) — no adversarial content can reach it, so this page

  // data-audit-box machinery (matrix's item.title, fontWeight 700;
  // row_cards' item.title, fontWeight bold) but neither was part of the
  // bold-metrics fix round's own 9-component sweep above (5d4c4a8) and
  // neither had ever appeared in `STRESS_DECKS` at all — the one real
  // end-to-end regression gap the bold-width defect class still had.
  //
  // `matrix` (cols=3, items=9, schema max) turned out to have a genuinely

  // this page pairs two adjacent pool entries per item (still real,
  // ordinary marketing phrases end to end, same reuse-not-invent spirit —
  // `roadmap`'s own page above already established appending a real extra
  // word to lengthen a phrase) — verified empirically (fitSvgLine, no
  // `bold`/`fontFamily` threaded, exactly matrix.tsx's pre-fix call shape)
  // to push the *fitted* text's true bold width 14-90px past contentW
  // across every pairing, comfortably past the auditor's 6px tolerance.
  // `x_title`/`y_title` separately push matrix's own historically fragile
  // fit paths (already hardened by the matrix.tsx fix trio — d13ed15/
  // 005c9ca/d79d750) to `CJK_LONG`-class severity for the first time inside
  // the real dual-gate pipeline, not just `matrix.test.tsx`'s own isolated
  // component probes.
  //
  // `row_cards` (6 items, schema max) keeps `title` at a single pool entry
  // deliberately, not by oversight: its one full-width card per item gives
  // `title` a ~946px box (icon-gutter-adjusted) — reaching the same true-
  // bold overflow there needs roughly 3x a single phrase's length, past
  // what any real "title" field plausibly holds, so stacking phrases here
  // would be padding for its own sake rather than adversarial-but-real
  // content (self-review's own "don't invent unless the field's realistic
  // shape demands it" line). Its adversarial pressure lands on the fields
  // the schema actually gives room to stress instead: `text` reuses
  // `CARD_TEXT_STRESS` — the same `layoutSvgText(..., maxLines: 2)` shape
  // this constant's own doc comment already names icon_cards/steps as
  // covering — and `highlight` alternates so both the accent- and default-
  // stroke card paths render side by side.
