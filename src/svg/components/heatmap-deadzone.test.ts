// Regression pin for the review-round finding on `heatmap.tsx`'s `safeEased`
// (structure-components wave 2 task 2, post-approval fix round): a theme
// whose entire `colors.surface`→`colors.primary` interpolation path is
// *confined* inside the ~0.183-0.194 relative-luminance dead zone (see
// `heatmap.tsx`'s own `hasSafeInk` doc comment) has no `eased` value the
// 100-step search can escape to — `safeEased` degrades to "best-available
// ink" rather than a guaranteed-safe one. No canonical theme does this
// today (`full-matrix-contrast.test.ts` covers all 13 green), and
// `registerTheme` (`themes/definitions.ts`) performs zero color/contrast
// validation on a caller-supplied `style` — a real, if currently
// hypothetical, extensibility gap the rest of this codebase's contrast
// machinery shares (not heatmap-specific).
//
// This file answers the question the review protocol asked first:
// **is the confined case audit-visible?** Runs the reviewer's own two
// synthetic constructions (adjacent-but-both-confined, and flat) through a
// real `registerTheme` + `renderSlideSvg` + `auditDeck` — never a mock —
// with a *realistic* `colors.text` token (a real theme's own value,
// `consulting`'s `#051C2C` — not literally `#000000`, which is darker than
// this codebase's own `DARK_INK` and would silently mask the exact defect
// this pin exists to catch, a mistake this fix round's own investigation
// made and corrected before writing this file). Answer: **yes** —
// `findContrastIssues` correctly attributes each cell's value text to that
// cell's own real fill (not the page background) and reports it as
// `low-contrast` at the expected ~4.38-4.44 ratio, below the 4.5 floor.
// The confinement case is therefore already deterministic and
// audit-visible, not silent — `pptpress audit` (and this suite) both catch
// it every time, on every value, with no escape. A third control case
// (endpoints straddling the band) confirms this isn't a general
// over-triggering — it passes clean.
