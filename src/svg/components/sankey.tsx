/**
 * Layered flow diagram (structure-components wave 2 task 3 — the wave's
 * largest component and its sharpest differentiator): Anthropic's own
 * official pptx-authoring skill classifies a sankey as "PowerPoint has no
 * native form for this" and ships it as a rasterized image. This component
 * routes every node bar (native `<rect>`) and flow band (a cubic-bezier
 * `<path>`) through the existing SVG -> custGeom pipeline
 * (`pptx/svg2pptx/path.ts`'s `pathToOp`/`segsToOp` — a single fully generic
 * SVG-path-grammar walker with no per-shape idiom branches anywhere in that
 * file. M/L/C/Z is exactly the command set it already handles for every
 * `<path>` this codebase emits, this one included — verified by
 * `generate-sankey-export.test.ts`'s zero-p:pic assertion) — the export
 * carries zero `<p:pic>` for this component, natively editable vectors, not
 * a picture of a chart.
 *
 * **Layout: deterministic, hand-rolled in-repo, same posture as flowchart.**
 * Both sankey and flowchart own geometry here ("engine owns geometry",
 * `docs/concepts.md`'s settled decision). A sankey's node *height* must be
 * proportional to its total through-flow (value-driven geometry, plan task
 * 3 item 2): a generic layered box layout would only buy the x-axis
 * (layer) assignment while still requiring a fully custom y-axis (value
 * stacking) pass on top, so this file owns 100% of the geometry itself end
 * to end rather than splitting one diagram's layout across two different
 * algorithms with two different determinism stories to audit. Every step
 * below is pure arithmetic over `nodes`/`links` in their *authored array
 * order* — no `Math.random`, no `Date`, and every `Map`/`Set` is only ever
 * read via `.get(id)` keyed off that array order, never iterated directly
 * for a result-order-sensitive purpose — so two renders of the same
 * component are byte-identical by construction (pinned directly:
 * `sankey.test.tsx`'s "determinism" describe block, a multi-layer and a
 * dense-crossing-topology fixture, both rendered twice and diffed as
 * strings).
 *
 * **Layer assignment** (`computeLayers`): longest path from any source
 * (in-degree 0) via Kahn's algorithm with relaxation — `layer[v] =
 * max(layer[v], layer[u]+1)` on every `u -> v` edge, processed in
 * topological order. The initial queue is `nodes` filtered to in-degree 0
 * (authored order), and every subsequent enqueue walks a node's outgoing
 * links in the order `links` declared them — so the *traversal* order is
 * deterministic even though the resulting layer *values* are a pure
 * structural fact of the graph (any valid topological order yields the same
 * values). Schema-level cycle rejection (`ir/index.ts`'s `.superRefine`)
 * guarantees this terminates for any document that reached render through
 * `validateIr`. A defensive fallback below still terminates (never hangs)
 * for a hand-built `ComponentCtx`/component object that skipped validation
 * (e.g. a unit test), by dumping any node Kahn's couldn't resolve into one
 * trailing layer rather than looping forever.
 *
 * **Disconnected nodes render standalone, not rejected** (plan task 3 item
 * 4's explicit "decide with rationale"): a node with no links has in-degree
 * 0 by construction, so it lands in layer 0 automatically, no special case
 * needed. Rejecting it would punish a rough, legitimate graph description
 * (a model naming a node it hasn't wired up flows for yet) for a property
 * that costs nothing to render honestly — the same permissive posture this
 * codebase already takes for e.g. an empty optional field elsewhere.
 *
 * **Node weight -> height** (`nodeWeight`): a node's rendered height is
 * proportional to `max(inSum, outSum)` when it has both an inbound and
 * outbound side (the standard "a pass-through node is at least as tall as
 * its busier side" convention — this renderer does not force artificial
 * flow conservation), or whichever sum is nonzero for a pure source/sink.
 * A fully disconnected node falls back to the smallest real link value in
 * the diagram (`fallbackWeight`) — a deterministic, data-derived size
 * rather than an arbitrary constant, so it reads as "small" relative to
 * whatever else is on the page instead of an unrelated fixed number.
 *
 * **A real, disclosed consequence of not forcing conservation** (task-3 fix
 * round, review Minor finding 3 — rendered and visually inspected, not
 * just reasoned about on paper): a hub node whose in/out sums differ leaves
 * a real, visible, band-free gap along whichever side has less total flow
 * — e.g. a node receiving 100 total but sending on only 60 renders its
 * bands covering only the top ~60% of its own bar, an honest ~40% gap at
 * the bottom, not a bug or a missing band. This is the conventional way
 * every mainstream sankey renderer (d3-sankey included) shows a real
 * imbalance, and is schema-legal, deliberate behavior (this component
 * never invents a phantom link to force balance) — but it can plausibly
 * read as "something didn't render" to a first-time viewer, so it's called
 * out here explicitly rather than left only implicit in the height
 * formula. No visual affordance (a guide line, a dashed boundary) marks
 * the gap as intentional — reviewed and accepted as-is, not a follow-up
 * TODO — see the task-3 fix-round report for the rendered evidence.
 *
 * **Value -> pixel scale, budgeted not exploded** (`computeValueScale` —
 * cite the EMU/clamp lesson `chart-svg.tsx`'s `MAX_CHART_GEOMETRY_PX` names,
 * plan task 3 item 2's "no absolute-value geometry explosions"): unlike
 * that clamp, which bounds an *unanchored* ratio-scaled extent (a bar chart
 * value has no fixed total to fit inside), a sankey's node stack has a
 * hard, known ceiling — the content box's own height — so the scale is
 * solved backward from that ceiling instead of forward from the raw value:
 * `scale = min` over every layer of `(availableHeight - thatLayer'sGapBudget)
 * / thatLayer'sTotalWeight`. The most-loaded layer is always the binding
 * constraint, and every other, lighter layer necessarily fits with room to
 * spare — there is no code path that can scale a value into an
 * off-canvas/EMU-overflow extent the way an unanchored ratio can, so no
 * `MAX_CHART_GEOMETRY_PX`-style ceiling is needed here (mirrors
 * `heatmap.tsx`'s own "values feed a bounded quantity, not an absolute
 * extent" reasoning, confirmed empirically the same way:
 * `generate-sankey-export.test.ts`'s 1:10000-ratio fixture exports cleanly
 * through the real `generatePptx`). `MIN_NODE_H`/`MIN_BAND_H` still floor
 * an individual tiny-but-positive value at a visible minimum thickness
 * (plan task 3 item 4's "bands floor at visible minimum" decision, chosen
 * over dropping — a dropped band would silently misrepresent the graph's
 * own declared topology) — the one place this component deliberately lets
 * the tightest layer's total run a few px past `availableHeight`, bounded by
 * `node/link count * floor`, never by the value ratio itself, so it can
 * never explode.
 *
 * **Band opacity prevents a false-positive audit *attribution* — it does
 * not, by itself, make a label safe** (task-3 fix round, review Major
 * finding — corrected from this comment's own earlier, wrong claim that it
 * did). `BAND_OPACITY` (0.45) is chosen to sit *below* `deck-audit.ts`'s
 * `MIN_BG_OPACITY` (0.5) — the gate that decides whether a painted shape
 * becomes a contrast-attribution background *candidate* at all
 * (`docs/contrast-system.md`'s "Audit measurement" section) — so a band can
 * never be mis-picked as a label's background by the SVG-level audit walk,
 * and (verified directly, `auditDeck(ir, {pixels:true})`) never enters the
 * `--pixels` layer's candidate pool either, since that layer only ever
 * looks at runs whose SVG-resolved background came back `null`, and this
 * one resolves cleanly to the page bg. **Both of those are true and both
 * are beside the real point**: bands cross the same horizontal gap a
 * neighboring node's label sits in, so a label's glyphs can — and in real
 * rendered output, do — sit visually on top of a translucent band. A
 * viewer never sees "the page bg, unmodified" there — they see the real
 * *composite* of the band's fill over the page bg at `BAND_OPACITY`, and
 * that composite can measure meaningfully worse contrast than the page bg
 * alone (confirmed empirically at real rendered-pixel ground truth: the
 * dense-crossing fixture's own `campaign`/`insight` themes measured
 * 4.30:1/4.34:1 against a plain-page-bg-computed ink, both under the 4.5:1
 * body floor). Neither audit layer can ever be taught to see this
 * *without* also re-admitting the exact false-positive `BAND_OPACITY`
 * exists to prevent — so the actual safety guarantee has to live here, in
 * the renderer, which is the one place that genuinely knows both a label's
 * real position and every band's real geometry and fill at once.
 * `accessibleInkAgainstAll` (below) is that guarantee: every label's ink is
 * computed against the real composite of every band its own box
 * geometrically overlaps, not against the plain page bg alone — pinned red
 * (pre-fix, reproducing the reported ratios) then green by
 * `full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`'s dedicated "label-over-band blended
 * contrast" sweep (13 themes, analytic-blend + real-geometry-overlap,
 * reading the actual rendered `fill`/position off real SVG output — the
 * same method the review used to find this, not a self-graded shortcut).
 *
 * **Band color and node color are deliberately different roles**: a band's
 * fill is keyed to its *source* node's stable index into `chartPalette`
 * (`rotateChartPalette(ctx.colors.chartPalette, ctx.chartPaletteOffset ??
 * 0)` — the same per-deck seed-phase rotation `chart.tsx` already opts into,
 * verified by this file's own "ctx.chartPaletteOffset rotates band colors"
 * test) — every band
 * leaving one node reads as one consistent color, the conventional sankey
 * reading ("trace this source's share downstream"). A node's own bar stays
 * a flat, unblended `colors.surface` (the same "flat-surface" class
 * `icon_cards.tsx`/`kpi.tsx`'s card shells already are, pre-verified at
 * 4.5:1 by the bento-panel contrast check) — coloring the *node* by
 * palette would be ambiguous for a pass-through node with multiple
 * differently-colored inbound bands, so nodes stay neutral and only bands
 * carry the palette.
 *
 * **No text ever renders on a band or a node bar's own fill beyond the
 * label itself**: link values are deliberately not drawn as text (unlike
 * `heatmap.tsx`'s optional `show_values`) — keeping this file to exactly
 * one text-bearing surface (the node label, which may sit on the plain page
 * background, a band composite, or both depending on real overlap — see
 * `accessibleInkAgainstAll`) avoids a second, independent self-painted-
 * surface contrast chain to maintain for a v1 scope the plan does not ask
 * for. `MUTED_SURFACE_CLASS["sankey"]` is therefore `"no-muted-fill"` — this
 * component never renders `colors.muted` at all, node labels use
 * `colors.text` routed through `accessibleInkAgainstAll`.

 * `ink.ts`'s `accessibleInk`/`readableOn` from "safe against one bg" to
 * "safe against every real candidate at once, when a single flat ink
 * can":
 *  - keeps `preferredFill` only when it already clears the required ratio
 *    against **every** candidate, not just one
 *  - otherwise derives the small set of inks `readableOn` would pick across
 *    the candidates (in practice at most 2: near-black/white) and returns

 *
 * **Not always sufficient on its own — a real, measured residual, not a
 * hypothetical** (found while verifying this exact fix, independently
 * confirmed against the review's own geometric-overlap data): a node with
 * multiple stacked outgoing/incoming links can legitimately present more
 * than one differently-colored band to the *same* label at once (its
 * label sits at the node's vertical center — three stacked bands of
 * different `chartPalette` hues can each cross that narrow band), and
 * those bands' blends can require *opposite* ink directions — e.g.
 * measured directly on campaign's own palette: a blend toward `#3d70aa`
 * only clears 4.5:1 with white (5.13 vs black's 3.77), while a blend
 * toward `#91785e` only clears it with near-black (4.65 vs white's 4.16).
 * No single flat ink can satisfy both simultaneously. This function still
 * returns its best *available* single-ink answer (the higher-minimum
 * choice) even then — `isSafeAgainstAll` below is how the caller detects
 * that residual and escalates to a stronger fix (a backing chip) rather
 * than silently shipping the best-effort answer as if it were guaranteed.
