/**
 * Value-driven color grid (structure-components wave 2 task 2): shape comes
 * straight from `x_labels`/`y_labels` (cols = x_labels.length, rows =
 * y_labels.length — no separate numeric `cols`/`rows` field to drift out of
 * sync, `ir/index.ts`'s own `.refine` chain enforces `values` stays exactly
 * that rectangle). Every cell's fill is a deterministic single-hue
 * luminance interpolation from `colors.surface` toward `colors.primary`
 * (`cellFill` below) — the same `mixHex` primitive `matrix.tsx`'s `toneFill`
 * already uses, not a new color system (plan ruling 5: "禁止自造脱离主题的
 * 色系"). Optional per-cell value text (`show_values`), when on, measures
 * its ink against *that cell's own computed fill* via `accessibleInk`
 * (`contrast-system.md`'s self-painted-surface discipline) — three
 * deterministic links, value → color → ink, each independently verifiable.
 *
 * Two geometry precedents this file explicitly reuses rather than
 * reinventing:
 *  - `axis-titles.tsx`'s horizontal pair (y_title "  ↑" then x_title
 *    "  →" on one line, **below** the grid). Reserve a band's height when
 *    either field is present, and subtract it from whichever one of
 *    measure()'s-own-fallback/box.h *actually includes it* — never both
 *    (matrix.tsx's own `render` doc comment has the full incident writeup).
 *    `x_title`/`y_title` here describe the *whole* axis (optional, e.g.
 *    "Quarter") — a distinct field from `x_labels`/`y_labels`, which are the
 *    mandatory per-column/per-row headers themselves.
 *  - `chart.tsx`/`chart-svg.tsx`'s box.h-independent category-label
 *    treatment: `x_labels`/`y_labels` render with `colors.muted` (the same
 *    token `chart-svg.tsx`'s category ticks use) directly on the ambient
 *    page background — pre-verified 4.5:1-safe in every theme
 *    (`MUTED_SURFACE_CLASS`'s "page-bg" class) — while the *cell* value text
 *    is the one surface here that actually needs a fresh `accessibleInk`
 *    measurement, because unlike a category tick it sits on a self-painted,
 *    per-cell computed fill, not the page background.
 *
 * Degenerate domain (`domain.min === domain.max`, either explicit or every
 * value in `values` happening to be equal): `valueT` returns a flat 0.5 for
 * every cell instead of dividing by a zero range — deterministic, no
 * NaN/Infinity, matching the "provably non-degenerate domain floor"
 * discipline `gantt.tsx`'s `axisBounds`/`chart-svg.tsx`'s `renderDumbbell`
 * `vx()` fix already established for this codebase's other value→geometry
 * mappings. Values feed *color* here, never geometry (cell rect extents come
 * from `x_labels.length`/`y_labels.length` alone, schema-capped at 10×10) —
 * so `MAX_CHART_GEOMETRY_PX`'s own EMU-overflow trap has no analog to guard
 * here; `generate-heatmap-export.test.ts` verifies an extreme-magnitude
 * value (feeding only `valueT`'s ratio, clamped to [0,1]) exports cleanly
 * through the real `generatePptx`, confirming this by construction rather
 * than only asserting it in prose.

 * real `DARK_INK`/`LIGHT_INK` constants, `ink.ts` — not a paper estimate),
 * *neither* `readableOn`'s near-black (`#0A0E14`, not literally
 * 0-luminance) nor pure white clears 4.5:1 — the two-ink comparison's own
 * break-even point (`ink.ts`'s `LUMINANCE_INK_THRESHOLD` doc comment names
 * ~0.19) sits exactly where the *achievable* contrast from either candidate
 * dips to ~4.4, just under the body-text floor. A continuous
 * `colors.surface`→`colors.primary` lerp necessarily crosses this band at
 * some `eased` value between its two endpoints (surface is high-luminance,
 * primary is typically low — a monotonic luminance descent must pass
 * through every luminance in between, intermediate value theorem), so this
 * is not a bug in one specific theme's token choice — it is unavoidable for
 * *any* continuous light→dark ramp under this codebase's binary black/white
 * ink model, confirmed by the initial (unguarded) version of this ramp
 * failing `full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`: the representative content sweep
 * passed clean with no nudge at all, but the schema-max 10×10 sweep (dense
 * enough to statistically hit the ~1-in-50 dead-zone width on some cell)
 * failed on 12/13 themes, and the negative-distribution cell-ink probe
 * failed on 3/13 — 12/13 themes affected somewhere across the full battery
 * (review fix round measurement; supersedes an earlier, narrower "5/13"
 * figure from before those two sweeps existed). `safeEased` below is the
 * fix: when `show_values` will actually paint text on a cell (the only case
 * this matters — no text, no contrast requirement), nudge that cell's own
 * `eased` fraction away from the dead zone rather than accepting whichever
 * color the raw lerp landed on.
 *
 * **Confinement is a real, disclosed residual, not silently swallowed**
 * (review fix round finding 1): a theme whose *entire* surface→primary path
 * sits inside the band (both endpoints confined, or `surface === primary`
 * exactly in-band) has no `eased` value `safeEased` can escape to — the
 * search degrades to whichever boundary it hits, still the
 * `accessibleInk`-chosen best-available ink, never a wrong/unreadable
 * color. No canonical theme does this (all 13 green,
 * `full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`), and `registerTheme` currently performs
 * no color/contrast validation on a caller-supplied `style` at all — a
 * systemic extensibility gap this component doesn't own or fix. What this
 * component *does* guarantee: the confined case is deterministically
 * **audit-visible**, not silent — `findContrastIssues` measures each
 * cell's value text against that cell's own real rendered fill and reports
 * it as a `low-contrast` finding every time, on every affected value, at
 * the same ~4.38-4.44 ratio this comment names
 * (`heatmap-deadzone.test.ts` pins this against a real `registerTheme` +
 * `auditDeck` reconstruction of the confined case, plus a straddling
 * control that stays clean). `pptwise audit` is the deterministic backstop
 * for the residual this loop's own boundary clamp cannot itself close.
