 * Real ink drop below the baseline for the footnote sizes the ten layouts

 * (`layout--banner-heading--zh` at 14, `--quote-stage--zh` at 16,

 * The byte-exact layout archives pin the resulting coordinates. This file

 * `FOOTNOTE_CLEARANCE` or the descent ratio has to be a deliberate act rather
 * than a number nudged until four archives went green again.
