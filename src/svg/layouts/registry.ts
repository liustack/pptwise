/**
 * Layout registry (W2 task 1, spec §3/§6/§8): an explicit, statically-checked
 * description of what the render chain's 118 standard layouts and 4
 * page-level image takeovers already draw. This is a metadata layer only.
 * It formalizes today's implicit page structure (layout JSX + the
 * FullSlideSvg takeover dispatch) into named `slots`, it does not change any
 * drawing code.
 *
 * **Aggregator, not author (src domain reorg wave 1, task T1d).** Every
 * individual `LayoutDefinition` used to live here as a literal Record entry.
 * Each one now lives beside the layout JSX it describes instead — an
 * `export const layoutDef: LayoutDefinition` at the bottom of the matching
 * `layouts/*.tsx` file, or one of 4 uniquely-named exports at the bottom
 * of `image-pages.tsx` for the takeovers (one file implements all 4, so they
 * can't share the uniform `layoutDef` name the 118 single-layout
 * files use) — so "take one layout away whole" is a single-file operation
 * instead of a two-file archaeology dig. This file's own job is now purely
 * computational aggregation: import every `layoutDef`, assemble the five
 * Records below (`{ [def.id]: def }`-style, preserving the exact key order
 * the pre-migration literals held — order is load-bearing, not cosmetic, see
 * `registry.migration-guard.test.ts`'s own header comment), merge them into
 * `LAYOUT_REGISTRY`, and keep every type, query function
 * (`getLayout`/`layoutsForSlideType`), and validation function
 * (`filterByNarrativesOnly`) that reads the result. Never a re-export relay
 * — every line below either constructs a Record or queries/validates one
 * (this wave's aggregator discipline).
 *
 * Source of truth for each definition's own content: the layout file it
 * now lives in, `.issues/notes/engineering-history.md`
 * (the W2 pre-flight inventory), plus a direct re-read of the layout file
 * itself — where the inventory's summary and the code disagreed, the code
 * won (see the W2 task report for the one confirmed case: image-annotate).
 *
 * Slot `accepts` convention used throughout every `layoutDef`:
 *  - `[]` (empty array): the slot is *not* fed by an authored component
 *    — it's derived straight from slide-level scalar fields (`slide.heading`,
 *    `slide.subheading`), `ir.meta.*` (organization/date/version/contact/
 *    copyright/confidentiality), or pure computed geometry (chapter-number
 *    watermarks, rail progress dots, decorative motifs inline in the
 *    layout file). There is nothing here for an author to place.
 *  - `"any"`: the slot renders whatever `Component`s it's handed, unfiltered
 *    (`SvgContent`'s body, bento's grid, stacked-poster's hero/strip).
 *  - a literal component-type list: the slot requires that specific component
 *    type (`image`, `bullets`) — used only by the 4 takeover layouts, which
 *    `Array.find` a specific component type out of `slide.components`.

// Content standard layouts (17 total: 10 auto-selectable and 7 pin-only).
// The quote-stage wave grew the group from 12 to 13 with quote-stage,
// pptwise's first `pinOnly` member (see {@link LayoutDefinition.pinOnly}):
// reachable only through an explicit `slide.layout` pin, never auto-picked,
// so it doesn't grow any theme's curated pool — "12 auto-selectable + 1
// pin-only", not a flat +1 (see that file's own composition-sketch header);
// content-layout expansion wave task T2 grew the auto-selectable count
// 11 -> 12 just before it — split-band, the pool's first *horizontal* split
// (a full-bleed header band over an ordinary body band) — see that file's
// own composition-sketch header for the capacity measurement that chose its
// ratio; task T1 grew this same family 10 -> 11 just before it —
// image-lead-split, the first layout whose column split is genuinely
// unequal — see that file's own composition-sketch header; P1 variety wave
// task 4 grew this same family 7 -> 10 before it, content having been the
// pool's thinnest page type, the C-investigation's own finding, dr/
// c-diversity.md) — the only family that reads `slide.components`, so
// every entry carries a `body` slot plus its own heading band, and declares
// `arrangements` (inventory decision #2: layouts that don't obey the
// author's arrangement still truthfully declare which arrangement(s) they
// honor, behavior unchanged).
//
// `body` slot `capacity` (W2 task 5 — filling the placeholder task 1 left
// here): declarative authoring-time metadata only, same convention as the
// `hero`/`strip`/`grid`/`annotation` slots below — consumed since W3 by the
// validate-layer `min(pacing editorial budget, layout capacity)` quality
// gate (ir-quality.ts via layout-selection.ts). Numbers are the
// geometry-honest per-layout component count, sourced from the pre-W3
// CAPACITY table's derivations (not invented fresh):
//   - single-stack layouts — narrow-column/rail-numbered/
//     tone-adaptive-content, plus stacked-poster's degrade path
//     (content-stacked-poster.tsx's own comment on its layoutDef already
//     establishes it behaves like the
//     other four "all" layouts once it falls back to SvgContent): 4,
//     mirroring the former `CAPACITY.maxBlocksPerSlide` (deleted in W3 — the editorial side now lives in PACING_BUDGETS) — audit/capacity.ts's flat,
//     theme-independent default (`floor(minRectH / perBlock)`, the shared
//     derivation for every linear-stack theme).
//   - two-column: 4 too — the arrangement splits components into 2 narrower
//     columns (`(rect.w - COLUMN_GAP) / 2`, layout.ts) but shares the same
//     content-height budget as the single-stack layouts, not a taller one,
//     so two columns doesn't earn a higher total than one.
//   - bento-panel: 6, matching this same layout's own `grid` slot
//     capacity below — not the flat default. `layoutBento`'s hard 6-cell
//     ceiling (bento-layout.ts: "the bento grid only ever has 6 cells") and
//     the former theme-keyed `CAPACITY.maxBlocksPerSlideOverrides.tech = 6`
//     (deleted in W3 — this layout-keyed entry is its home now) both land on the
//     same number for the same non-linear grid geometry independently.
//     `body` is bento-panel's *degraded* single-stack rendering of the exact
//     same component sequence the grid would otherwise hold (see that
//     entry's own comment), so it shares the grid's number rather than a
//     lesser invented one.
//     Final semantics (W4, recorded once the full-set rollout made
//     bento-panel reachable from every theme, not just tech): this capacity-6
//     ceiling never actually binds the `min(pacing editorial budget, layout
//     capacity)` density gate. `PACING_BUDGETS`'s loosest pacing
//     (`dense`) tops out at 5 components/slide — still under 6 — so every
//     pacing's own editorial budget wins the `min()` for this layout
//     (5/4/3 for dense/balanced/spacious, never 6). The number above is
//     bento-panel's true geometric ceiling and stays for documentation and
//     for any future pacing tier looser than 5, but no deck can reach it
//     through today's gate.
//   - asymmetric-triptych/quiet-frame (task 4's remaining layouts after
//     side-highlight retired): 4, the same flat single-stack default every
//     layout but bento-panel already carries — neither body's region exceeds
//     the pool's existing narrowest single-stack width (880px,
//     `narrow-column`'s `COLUMN_W`), so no new per-layout number is
//     warranted (each file's own composition-sketch header derives this
//     explicitly, not just asserts it).
//   - image-lead-split (task T1): body 4 too, and visual 1 — its 435px text
//     column is narrower than every other layout's own single-stack
//     column, but still wider than the pool's already-audited narrowest
//     single-stack region (asymmetric-triptych's 424px `top`/`bottom`
//     panels), so this doesn't warrant a new number either, nor tightening
//     any `audit/capacity.ts` floor — the file's own header derives this.
//   - split-band (task T2): body 4 too — its 400px (380px with a footnote)
//     body height is *shorter* than every other layout's own body
//     region (the pool's previous floor was width, not height; this is the
//     first layout whose heading band eats vertical rather than
//     horizontal budget), which is exactly why this task's own capacity
//     measurement (see the file's own composition-sketch header) tested
//     candidate ratios against realistic per-tier content *before* fixing
//     the geometry, instead of assuming the pool's flat 4 would still be
//     safe at a new, shorter height. It held at zero `data-dropped` for
//     ordinary content at every pacing tier, so 4 stays the declared
//     number — no `audit/capacity.ts` floor needs tightening either, by
//     the same "re-verified, not assumed" standard image-lead-split's own
//     entry above already established for a *width* floor.
//   - quote-stage (quote-stage wave, task T2): body 1 — not a flat-default
//     single-stack number like every entry above. This is the pool's first
//     `pinOnly` member (see {@link LayoutDefinition.pinOnly}): the body
//     slot is a small attribution/footnote *annotation* position below an
//     oversized heading, not a "承重" content region — 1 is a deliberate,
//     narrow authoring contract (at most one short attribution component),
//     not a geometric ceiling derived from column width like the other
//     entries' 4/6. Enforced two ways: `ir-quality.ts`'s `density` warn
//     (min(pacing budget, this capacity) — same generic gate every entry
//     here already feeds) *and*, because this is a pinned-only layout, a
//     dedicated hard *error* (`pin_only_over_capacity`, quote-stage wave
//     T2's own 裁定 2) — an explicit pin already declares author intent, so
//     silently dropping content past capacity 1 would be real content loss,
//     not an editorial nudge.
//
// This essay is what every content layout's own body-slot capacity
// comment means by "see registry.ts's CONTENT_LAYOUT_DEFS header for the
// derivation" (src domain reorg wave 1, task T1d — reworded from the
// pre-migration "see file header derivation" once each entry moved into its
// own layout file). It stays here, comparative across all 17, rather
// than traveling with any one entry.
