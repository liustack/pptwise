/**
 * Safe-font resolution for the single-source SVG renderer.
 *
 * pptxgenjs writes a single `fontFace` name into the .pptx; whatever the target
 * machine lacks gets silently substituted by PowerPoint. The 6 themes lead with
 * designer fonts (Sectra / Inter / Lora …) that are absent on a stock Windows
 * install, so we resolve each font stack down to the first member PowerPoint can
 * actually render, falling back to a CJK+Latin-covering default by role.
 *
 * The set is intentionally Windows-guaranteed. Latin faces here (Georgia, Arial,
 * Consolas …) also ship on macOS, but Mac-only faces (PingFang SC) are excluded
 * so a deck authored on a Mac still renders predictably on Windows.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Two separate judgment axes, not one (borrow-wave Task 3, 2026-07-21):
 *
 * 1. AVAILABILITY (what SAFE_FONTS actually decides) -- will a stock Windows
 *    or Office install have this face at all, so PowerPoint renders the
 *    requested glyphs instead of silently substituting a different font.
 *
 * 2. METRIC RELIABILITY -- once a face is confirmed available, does the
 *    layout engine's width model (`measureTextUnits` in
 *    `src/lib/svg-text-layout.ts`, a font-agnostic per-character-class
 *    heuristic) still predict that face's real advance width closely enough
 *    to size/wrap/shrink text without overflow. A font can pass (1) and
 *    fail (2), or vice versa -- they are independent questions, and
 *    SAFE_FONTS membership on its own answers only the first one.
 *
 * Anthropic's official pptx-generation skill classifies both Georgia and
 * Consolas -- two of this file's SAFE_FONTS members, and the actual export
 * faces for pptpress's default theme (consulting: Georgia heading+body) and
 * every theme's code component (Consolas, all 13 themes, via ROLE_DEFAULT
 * below) -- as "QA-unreliable" rather than "safe". That is axis (2)
 * judgment. This file's SAFE_FONTS is axis (1) judgment. The two
 * classifications disagreeing is not a contradiction to paper over -- they
 * are answering different questions, and pptpress had never actually
 * measured axis (2) for these faces before borrow-wave Task 3 (the one
 * prior width-safety mechanism, `code.tsx`'s `MONO_WIDTH_SAFETY`, was
 * itself calibrated against Menlo, a macOS preview stand-in, not the real
 * exported Consolas).
 *
 * Task 3's real-font measurement (fontTools `hmtx`-table reads of the
 * genuine binaries, cross-validated against real-Chromium `canvas.
 * measureText()` -- see task-3-report.md, borrow-wave scratchpad, not
 * shipped in this repo) resolved axis (2) for all three fonts this file
 * actually exports today:
 *   - Georgia (consulting heading+body default, academic/insight heading):
 *     measured safe. No width factor added -- see the calibration note
 *     above `measureTextUnits` in svg-text-layout.ts.
 *   - Consolas (mono/code, all 13 themes via ROLE_DEFAULT): measured
 *     genuinely risky in the dangerous (real-wider-than-assumed) direction
 *     for the *proportional* width model `measureTextUnits` uses. Task 3
 *     first mitigated this by recalibrating `code.tsx`'s
 *     `MONO_WIDTH_SAFETY` (0.9 -> 0.82) against the real binary. A same-
 *     task review round then found deep-indented code could still overflow
 *     past any fixed safety factor on top of a proportional estimate (see
 *     `MONO_WIDTH_SAFETY`'s derivation comment in code.tsx), so the mono
 *     role now skips the proportional model entirely and sizes text with
 *     an exact per-glyph width -- Consolas's own uniform hmtx advance, via
 *     `measureMonoTextUnits` in svg-text-layout.ts (see that function's
 *     derivation comment).
 *   - Microsoft YaHei (body/fallback ROLE_DEFAULT, six themes' actual
 *     heading+body face): measured safe. No width factor added.
 *
 * A related but distinct gap surfaced during that measurement, not a width
 * question at all: neither Georgia nor Consolas contains a single CJK
 * glyph. Any CJK character in text declared under either face never
 * renders from that face -- PowerPoint substitutes some other, currently
 * uncontrolled font at the glyph level for just those characters. Width
 * calibration cannot fix a missing-glyph problem -- this file's
 * SAFE_FONTS/resolveFontFace axis only ever spoke to the `<a:latin>` slot a
 * DrawingML run carries, never the separate `<a:ea>` (East Asian) slot
 * PowerPoint actually consults for CJK glyphs. Left unresolved at the time
 * (borrow-wave Task 3), this is now closed: `eaFontFaceFor` below resolves
 * the correct `<a:ea>` face for any already-resolved `<a:latin>` face, and
 * `src/pptx/pptx-ea-fonts.ts`'s `applyEaFontFaces` JSZip patch (wired into
 * every `generatePptxBlob` export) writes it into every exported run. CJK
 * glyphs now resolve from a face that actually has them, independent of
 * whichever Latin face the same run also carries.
 *
 * Swapping a SAFE_FONTS member for a more metric-reliable one (e.g.
 * consulting's Georgia -> Cambria, which Anthropic's skill does classify
 * safe) is a real, available option -- but it is a user-facing visual
 * design decision, not a mechanical safety fix, so this task documents it
 * as an option in task-3-report.md rather than executing it. SAFE_FONTS
 * membership itself is unchanged by this task.
 *
 * Decision (2026-07-22): keep Georgia. Our own hmtx measurements found its
 * widths inside `measureTextUnits`'s tolerance, the golden-anchor tests in
 * `svg-text-layout.golden.test.ts` now guard that agreement against drift,
 * and the "QA-unreliable" label came from a rig (LibreOffice-rendered QA)
 * this engine does not depend on. Identity beats a swap with no measured
 * safety benefit. Revisit only if a real overflow traces back to a Georgia
 * metric miss.

 * character in the same run falls through to PowerPoint's own uncontrolled
 * substitution the instant the declared `<a:ea>` face can't render it --
 * this file's header comment's "related but distinct gap."
 *
 * The mapping is face-keyed, not role-keyed or content-keyed:
 *
 * - A `SAFE_FONTS` member that already ships CJK glyphs (`CJK_SAFE_FACES`
 *   above -- Microsoft YaHei/SimSun/SimHei/KaiTi/FangSong and their Chinese
 *   aliases) resolves to *itself*: an explicit, self-referencing `<a:ea>`
 *   that changes no rendered pixel (the face already covers CJK) but
 *   completes the declaration -- PowerPoint no longer has to guess, closing
 *   exactly the gap `slides_maker`'s `CJK_NO_EA` lint (competitive
 *   research, borrow wave) flags.
 * - Every other `SAFE_FONTS` member (the 11 Latin-only sans/serif/mono
 *   faces -- Georgia, Consolas, Arial, etc.) resolves to the fixed
 *   `EA_FALLBACK_FACE`, regardless of that Latin face's own role
 *   (heading/body/mono) or design register (serif vs sans vs mono). This is
 *   a deliberately role-agnostic, pragmatic default, not a font-matching
 *   exercise: it never introduces a *second* missing-font risk on top of
 *   the one this function exists to close, since it's the same face
 *   `ROLE_DEFAULT` already relies on. The mono role gets no special
 *   CJK-monospace treatment either -- no `SAFE_FONTS` member is both
 *   Windows-safe and a monospace CJK face, so a Consolas-declared code
 *   block's CJK comment text renders in the same (proportional) Microsoft
 *   YaHei as any other non-CJK-capable face's fallback. This also firms up
 *   rather than undercuts `measureMonoTextUnits`'s own pre-existing CJK
 *   width assumption (`svg-text-layout.ts`): that model already sizes a
 *   mono-role CJK character at ~1 em specifically because it measured
 *   Microsoft YaHei's CJK class landing there, on the reasoning that CJK
 *   substitution would likely land near it -- this function now makes that
 *   *exactly* what renders, deterministically, instead of a best guess
 *   about where PowerPoint's uncontrolled substitution would land.
 *
 * Case-insensitive and quote/whitespace-trimming, mirroring
 * `resolveFontFace`'s own matching (a caller always passes that function's
 * return value, which preserves whatever casing the theme's own font stack
 * used). A face outside `SAFE_FONTS` entirely -- which no real caller
 * produces, since `resolveFontFace` only ever returns a `SAFE_FONTS` member
 * or a `ROLE_DEFAULT` value, both always in `SAFE_FONTS` -- still falls
 * back to `EA_FALLBACK_FACE` rather than throwing, so a future caller
 * outside that guarantee degrades safely instead of crashing an export.
