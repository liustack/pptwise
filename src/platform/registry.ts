 * spec §3.1/§7 promise the default audit chain never starts a network

 * into rendered markup at all is a deck that deliberately keeps a remote URL
 * as its own asset `src`. Left there, a Node rasterizer could silently
 * attempt to fetch it (a real network request `pptpress audit` must never
 * make) and a browser canvas would silently drop it and taint the canvas
 * (the audit-v2 controller ruling this guard implements) — either way the
 * rasterized page would show *not what the text actually sits on*, which is
 * exactly the "checked nothing, reported clean" failure mode this whole
 * wave exists to rule out. Returns the offending URL for the caller's error
