 * a real render out of this repo's own SVG subset comes back visibly wrong,
 * which `node-rasterize.test.ts`'s probe suite exists to catch. Missing
 * Sharp is an explicit failure (`loadSharp` above), never a silent skip —
 * the pixel audit's own "未检查≠通过" contract extended to a missing
 * platform capability, spec §11.7's "契约层".
 *
 * `findRemoteAssetRef` guards this the same way it guards the browser
 * implementation (`browser.ts`) — see that function's own doc comment for
 * why the guard lives once, shared, rather than trusting every caller to
 * pre-filter: a Sharp/librsvg fetch of a remote `href` would be a real
 * network request from inside `pptpress audit`, which spec §3.1/§7 promise
 * never happens.
 *
 * No explicit `density` — an empirically-verified default (this task's own
 * probe): this renderer's root `<svg>` carries a `viewBox="0 0 1280 720"`
 * with no `width`/`height` attributes, and Sharp/libvips already resolves
 * that to a 1280×720 intrinsic size with no density hint at all (confirmed
 * directly — adding an explicit `density: 96` to match this renderer's own
 * 96-px/in convention (`constants.ts`) actually *overshoots* to 1707×960,
 * since Sharp's default SVG density is 72, not 96, and only applies when a
 * physical unit is present for it to scale). `.resize(width, height, {fit:
 * "fill"})` is kept anyway as a defensive guarantee of the exact requested
 * output size regardless of the source SVG's own sizing, not because it
 * currently changes anything.
