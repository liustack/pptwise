/**
 * carried-items wave, fix round — review finding F1: generate.ts's own
 * `try { await dedupeMediaInZip(zip) } catch { ... }` has been deliberately
 * forgiving since 85ebc1e for a *genuine* dedupe failure (bad media bytes,
 * malformed `.rels` XML — "a media-dedupe failure is not a reason to
 * abandon export," the package audit right after still catches any real
 * corruption under its own name). The runtime seal this wave's item 2 added
 * introduced a second, categorically different failure the same call can
 * now throw: a `PptxSealViolationError`, meaning `dedupeMediaInZip` itself
 * ran out of order (reordered to run after `normalizePptxTimestamps`
 * sealed the zip). The reviewer's injection proved that error was being
 * silently absorbed by the pre-existing catch — the fix distinguishes by
 * `instanceof` and rethrows only the seal violation.
 *
 * `dedupeMediaInZip` is mocked here (not the real function) so this file
 * can control exactly which of the two failure classes fires, independent
 * of what real duplicate media would actually trigger — the real-media,
 * no-mock end-to-end proof lives in generate-dedupe-media-export.test.ts.
 * pptxgenjs itself is *not* mocked — the same real-pipeline pattern
 * generate-determinism.test.ts already uses successfully under the default
 * jsdom environment (no `installNodePlatform()` needed for a no-image
 * fixture) — so this pins the real generate.ts call site, not a
 * reimplementation of its logic.
