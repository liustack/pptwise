 * Content-drop gate (deep-review P1): refuse to export a deck whose layout
 * had to throw content away to make the rest fit, unless the caller opts in
 * with `{ allowDroppedContent: true }` (`--allow-dropped-content`).
 *
 * Same shape and same reason as `checkDraftGate` in `../api.ts`: shipping a
 * deck that is quietly missing content is a worse failure mode than a loud
 * refusal, and the reader of the finished file is the one person who cannot
 * tell. `layoutContentFit` drops blocks that do not fit and marks them with
 * an invisible `data-dropped-silent` (`DroppedContentMarker` — the visible
 * "+N more" text was removed because a debug marker on a customer-facing
 * slide helps nobody), so before this gate the only trace was an `audit`
 * run nobody was obliged to make.
 *
 * Scoped to the silent kind on purpose. A component that trims its own
 * items still paints "+N …" on the slide (`components/bullets.tsx`,
 * `data-table.tsx`, `timeline.tsx`) — the reader is told, the deck is not
 * pretending to be complete, and `docs/concepts.md` already adjudicated
 * that case as graceful degradation plus an advisory audit finding. This
 * gate is for the case where nothing on the page admits anything is gone.
 *
 * It lives here rather than beside `checkDraftGate` because the question
 * "will this deck lose content?" can only be answered by a real layout, and
 * this is where the export already renders every slide — `slideToRender`
 * hands back the drop count from the same parse that produces the ops, so
 * the check costs no extra render and reads the exact markup that becomes
 * the file. Runs before `pptx.write`, so a refused export never pays for
 * serialization, patching or zipping.
 *
 * Deliberately not applied to `renderSlideSvg` (single-slide preview),
 * `preview --html`, `serve` or the gallery: rendering a deck that still has
 * problems is exactly what those exist for — the gate belongs on the one
 * path that produces a deliverable.
