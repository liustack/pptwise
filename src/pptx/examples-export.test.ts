// The shipped examples are the product's front door: `README.md` points at
// them, `skills/pptpress/SKILL.md` teaches models from them, and a new user's
// first command is usually `pptpress render examples/<one>.json`. Nothing was
// rendering five of the six — `scripts/e2e.mts` only ever rendered
// `examples/basic.json`, and the unit suite renders its own fixtures — so
// `examples/team-onboarding.json` shipped un-renderable through 0.19.2 and
// 0.20.0 (its `cycle` page exported text shapes with `a:ext cx <= 0`, which
// `package-audit.ts` rejects; see `svg2pptx/text.ts`'s `anchorTextBox`).
//
// This is the guard for that: every `examples/*.json`, discovered from disk
// rather than listed here, has to survive the whole export chain — the same
// `generatePptx` the CLI's `render` calls, package-audit gate included. Add
// an example and it is covered; break the export and this goes red before
// anything reaches a user.
//
// Why `pnpm check` and not `pnpm e2e`: nothing here needs a build or a
// subprocess (the defect it exists to catch is plain library code), and
// `check` is the gate that runs on every change while `e2e` runs when the
// render chain changes or a release is being cut — a guard against "no one
// noticed for two versions" belongs on the path nobody skips. Cost is in
// line with `all-themes.test.ts`, which already exports 17 decks here.
