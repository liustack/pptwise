import type JSZip from "jszip"

/**
 * Deduplicate identical media parts in-place on an already-loaded `zip`.
 *
 * PptxGenJS writes one media file per addImage call (`image-<slide>-<n>.<ext>`)
 * and only dedups within a single slide — so a shared background image placed on
 * N slides is embedded N times, bloating the file. This collapses byte-identical
 * media into a single part and repoints every relationship at it (the OOXML-native
 * "one media part, many relationships" shape that PowerPoint itself produces).
 *
 * Returns whether anything actually changed. Originally split out from a
 * since-removed `dedupePptxMedia` Blob-in/Blob-out wrapper (package-audit
 * wave, task 1 — that wrapper opened its own fresh `JSZip.loadAsync` and
 * re-serialized on every call) so `generate.ts`'s final pipeline step could
 * run this same mutation against the one `JSZip.loadAsync` it already did
 * for the package-audit hard gate instead — spec §10.4's "reuse the patch
 * chain's own final loadAsync, don't re-unzip." The wrapper itself became
 * dead code once `generate.ts` switched to calling this function directly
 * (every remaining production reference was in a comment) and was removed
 * (carried-items wave, P0 T4 carried item) — this function is the one
 * surviving surface, and stays exactly as it was: not defensive itself (an
 * unexpected failure propagates), the same posture `generate.ts`'s own
 * try/catch around its call site already documents as deliberate.
