// Regression coverage for task 1's blocking review finding: segsToOp
// (src/pptx/svg2pptx/path.ts) computed a <path>'s DrawingML bbox with no
// minimum-size floor, unlike its buildOp sibling (see that file's own
// zero-extent floor tests in ./svg2pptx/path.test.ts for the unit-level
// repro). Lucide's icon-dot/short-stroke idiom ("M12 8h.01", "M12 16v-4")
// produced custGeom shapes with cx=0 or cy=0 on their own — silently
// degenerate pre-audit, and an unconditional invalid-shape-transform export
// failure once the package-audit hard gate went live. callout's default
// icon (all 3 variants) and any icon-bearing kpi_cards/icon_cards item are
// the *default*, ordinary path every caller hits (icon_cards' `icon` field
// is mandatory) — 923/1756 (52.6%) of the shared Lucide catalog triggered
// this pre-fix (see this task's fix report for the full-sweep evidence;
// reproduced independently by this file's own author via the reviewer's own
// batched kpi_cards + generatePptxBlob method).
//
// Runs under the real Node/linkedom platform seam — the runtime
// generatePptx/generatePptxBlob's own hard gate actually executes under in
// production (same rationale as package-audit.test.ts/package-reader.test.ts)
// — and calls the REAL generatePptx (src/api.ts)/generatePptxBlob
// (./generate.ts), never a mock, closing the SVG-level/export-level
// test-coverage split the review named as the structural reason this slipped
// through (every existing callout/icon test renders SVG markup only; no test
// combined "a component that renders an <Icon>" with "a call to
// generatePptxBlob" before this file).

 *   19 names (catalog order, i.e. Object.keys(PPTX_ICONS) order) that threw
 *   invalid-shape-transform pre-fix — 30 total, all independently confirmed
 *   members of the 923-icon affected class.
 * - UNAFFECTED_SAMPLE: the first 15 catalog-order names that did NOT throw
 *   pre-fix (multi-primitive icons whose bbox was never degenerate) — a
