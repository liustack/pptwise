/**
 * CJK east-asian font-slot patch (follow-up to borrow-wave Task 3's
 * documented CJK glyph gap — see `fonts.ts`'s header comment and
 * `eaFontFaceFor`'s own doc comment for the mapping policy this applies).
 *
 * Pre-check finding: pptxgenjs 4.0.1 has no API to set `<a:ea>` (East
 * Asian) independently of `<a:latin>` — its `TextPropsOptions.fontFace` is
 * a single string (`node_modules/pptxgenjs/types/index.d.ts`), and its own
 * `genXmlTextRunProperties` (`pptxgen.cjs.js`) already writes all three font
 * slots from that one value whenever it's set:
 *
 * ```
 * <a:latin typeface="Georgia" pitchFamily="34" charset="0"/>
 * <a:ea typeface="Georgia" pitchFamily="34" charset="-122"/>
 * <a:cs typeface="Georgia" pitchFamily="34" charset="-120"/>
 * ```
 *
 * (verified by unzipping a real `generatePptxBlob` result — every text op
 * this codebase emits sets `op.fontFace` from the SVG `<text>` element's own
 * `font-family` attribute, which `resolveFontStack`/`resolveFontFace`
 * always populate, so this is the shape of every real run in a shipped
 * deck, not a hypothetical). So the bug is not a *missing* `<a:ea>` — it's
 * an `<a:ea>` already present but pointing at the same face as `<a:latin>`,
 * which for Georgia/Consolas (zero CJK glyphs — `fonts.ts`) still leaves
 * PowerPoint to silently substitute an uncontrolled font for any CJK
 * character in that run. There is no native pptxgenjs path that can
 * express a face-keyed `<a:latin>`≠`<a:ea>` mapping, so this patches the
 * written package directly — same JSZip-write-after-patch shape as the
 * sibling `render.ts`'s `applyGradientFills` and `pptx-animations.ts`'s
 * `applySlideTransitions`/`applyElementAnimations`.
 *
 * Unconditional, not content-gated: every `<a:latin>` in every slide part
 * gets a corrected `<a:ea>`, regardless of whether that specific run's text
 * contains any CJK character. A per-run "does this text contain CJK"
 * detector would make the exported bytes depend on run content in a way
 * nothing else in this pipeline does, and would still miss any run whose
 * text starts Latin-only but is later hand-edited in PowerPoint to add CJK
 * — declaring the correct `<a:ea>` face on every run costs nothing (a
 * Latin-only run's `<a:ea>` slot is simply never consulted) and closes the
 * gap completely rather than probabilistically.

 * Matches one `<a:latin typeface="X".../>`, optionally immediately followed
 * by its own `<a:ea typeface="Y".../>` — per ECMA-376's `CT_TextCharacterProperties`
 * child order (`latin`, `ea`, `cs`, all optional but order-fixed when
 * present), `<a:ea>` can only ever legally sit directly after `<a:latin>`
 * and before any `<a:cs>`, so anchoring on adjacency both finds the right
 * target and guarantees the rewrite can never reorder anything.
 *
 * Group 1 = the latin face (also what `eaFontFaceFor` is keyed on). Group 2
 * = the latin tag's own trailing attributes, preserved verbatim. Group 3 =
 * the existing ea tag's own trailing attributes when one is already present
 * (`undefined` when this run has no `<a:ea>` at all yet — group 3 only
 * matches inside the optional non-capturing wrapper, so a plain "no <a:ea>
 * here" leaves it `undefined` rather than an empty string).
 *
 * Zero-whitespace-adjacency assumption: the `<a:ea...>` alternative matches
 * only when it starts the instant `<a:latin...>`'s own `/>` ends, no space
 * or newline tolerated in between. This is exactly how pptxgenjs 4.0.1's
 * `genXmlTextRunProperties` builds the string today (plain `+=`
 * concatenation, no pretty-printing — verified against
 * `node_modules/pptxgenjs/dist/pptxgen.cjs.js`), so it holds for every real
 * run this codebase exports. It is not a documented/versioned contract on
 * pptxgenjs's part, though: a future `^4.0.1`-range release that reformats
 * this internal concatenation (e.g. adds a newline for readability) would
 * make the optional group stop matching for the affected runs — not a
 * silent no-op, but `patchEaFontsInXml` would then treat that run as
 * latin-only and *insert* a fresh `<a:ea>` right after `<a:latin>`, leaving
 * the old, now-unmatched (and still wrong) `<a:ea>` untouched immediately
 * after it — two `<a:ea>` siblings on one run, which `CT_TextCharacterProperties`
 * forbids (at most one `ea` child). `pptx-ea-fonts.test.ts`'s whitespace-variant
 * test pins today's exact behavior so a pptxgenjs upgrade that breaks this
 * assumption fails loud there (and independently, in the real-pptxgenjs e2e
 * leg) instead of shipping a malformed package silently.
