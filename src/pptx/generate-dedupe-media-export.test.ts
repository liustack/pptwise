/**
 * carried-items wave, fix round — review finding F1: the missing
 * integration-level proof that real duplicate media, flowing through the
 * *unmocked* generate.ts pipeline (pptxgenjs, dedupeMediaInZip,
 * normalizePptxTimestamps and its seal all real), actually collapses to
 * one media part — and that the reviewer's exact injected reorder (moving
 * dedupeMediaInZip to run after normalizePptxTimestamps) now fails loudly
 * instead of silently shipping un-deduped media, which is what the
 * seal-in-isolation tests (pptx-fixed-timestamps.test.ts) and the
 * mocked-dedupe catch tests (generate-dedupe-seal-catch.test.ts) could not
 * catch on their own — both bypass generate.ts's real call site, which is
 * exactly where the swallow lived.
