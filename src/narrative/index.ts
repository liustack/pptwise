   * looking accidental, so this note exists to close that off explicitly).
   * Its defining trait is an *asset-availability* choice, not an
   * *argument-style* one: the unconditional visual/text split depends on
   * whether the deck's author actually has a chart/photo worth leading with
   * (see `content-image-lead-split.tsx`'s own file header) — a pyramid deck,
   * a storytelling deck, a showcase deck, and a briefing deck can equally
   * have (or lack) a strong image to lead with, so no single strategy's
   * rhetorical register (MECE evidence-first, editorial restraint,
   * step-by-step procedure, glossy visual punch, plain scannability) owns
   * this composition more than another's. **Reconsidered specifically
   * against `showcase`** (the wave's final review, see `split-band`'s own
   * entry in `showcase.layoutTendencies` below): showcase's register is
   * visual *punch* (bold color blocks, opaque highlight panels), not visual
   * *presence* — having an image at all doesn't say anything about how
   * loudly the page asserts itself, so this layout's asset-dependence
   * still doesn't map onto showcase's own membership criterion the way
   * `split-band`'s full-bleed color band does. It still went back to
   * neutral, not out of inertia. It *does* carry a beat-level personality
   * instead (`BEAT_TENDENCIES`, `svg/layout-selection.ts` — `breathing`) —
   * that axis measures page-level density character, a question this
   * field's argument-style axis doesn't ask.
   *
   * **`split-band` (same wave, same task) does NOT join this field** — it
   * was originally proposed here on the same "frame, not argument" theory
   * above, but the wave's final review refuted that specific claim with
   * in-file evidence: `split-band`'s defining feature, a full-bleed
   * (x=0, w=1280) `colors.primary` header band, is the "bold opaque color
   * block" idiom that earns `showcase.layoutTendencies` membership (the
   * retired `side-highlight` panel used to share that register), and
   * showcase's identity picks (`fashion-masthead`/`fashion-chapter`/
   * `fashion-ending`) are themselves built from full-bleed color blocks —
   * visual weight *is* showcase's rhetorical register, not a
   * register-neutral frame choice. `split-band` is listed in

   * **Historical note (corrected P1 variety wave, task 3):** this field's
   * doc comment used to claim cover/chapter/ending stayed uniformly sampled

   * false when written (`theme.layouts` only curates the candidate *pool*,
   * spec §6 step 3 — the 13 built-in themes' pools are all the full registry
   * set for every slide type, so `theme.id` contributes zero shaping either —
   * see `.issues/.../dr/c-diversity.md`'s §1.1 measurement). Identity pages

 * wrong deck):
 *
 * - `undefined` → {@link DEFAULT_NARRATIVE} (the `general` preset's axes)
 * - a preset id string → that preset's axes (unknown id throws
 *   {@link PptpressError}, listing the available preset ids)
 * - a partial axes object → each axis defaults independently
 *   (strategy → "briefing", pacing → "balanced", audience → "public" — these
 *   happen to equal `DEFAULT_NARRATIVE`'s values because `general` *is* that
 *   exact combination, but the fallback here is per-axis, not "any omitted
 *   axis falls back to the whole default object")
 * - an `{id: <preset>}` object (T0b fix 2, scope-extended — see
 *   {@link rescueIdShape}) → silently treated as that bare preset-id string,
 *   the same weak-model shape slip `theme: {id: "consulting"}` invites by
 *   analogy. Folded directly into this function's own entry (not just a
 *   pre-parse pass two of its six call sites happen to run) so every caller
 *   — `validateIr`, `validateSpec`, `layout-selection.ts`,
 *   `full-slide-svg.tsx`, `ir-quality.ts`, `cli/commands.ts` alike — gets
 *   this tolerance for free, present and future. Silent here (no rewrite
 *   note — this is a pure resolver with no reporting channel, and adding one
 *   would ripple into every one of those call sites' own return-shape
 *   expectations); `validateIr`/`validateSpec` additionally run
 *   {@link normalizeNarrativeShape} on their own raw pre-parse input first,
 *   specifically to report + persist the rewrite into what they return.
 *
 * An unknown axis value, or an unknown key on the partial axes object,
 * always throws {@link PptpressError} (never silently ignored or dropped) —
 * omission and a typo are different intents, and only the former has a
 * reasonable default. A mixed `{id, strategy}`-style shape is exactly this
 * case ({@link rescueIdShape} declines it): `id` is simply an unrecognized
 * key, so it hard-errors the same as any other typo.
 *
 * Renamed from `resolveScenario` (spec §8.1). Callers that still hold a
 * pre-rename `mode`/`delivery` shaped input (e.g. a v3 IR's `scenario`
 * field) must migrate it first — see `migrateIrV3ToV4`
 * (`src/ir/migrate.ts`) for the deterministic field/value mapping. A
 * v4-track document that still writes the old field/value spelling gets no
 * such rescue (spec §16, reversing the now-superseded §15.4): this function
 * hard-errors on it, same as any other unknown axis key or value. The
 * `{id}` shape above is not that — it was never a v3 `scenario` shape, just
 * a new confusion weak models invent by analogy to `theme.id`.
