  // exercised against real (not hand-crafted) markup too. `audit-
  // baseline.test.ts` already proves these render with zero *overflow*;
  // this reuses the same decks as a regression net for the two new check
  // families instead of hunting for bespoke fixtures per theme.
  //
  // `overlap` is asserted zero across the *entire* matrix — no legitimate
  // design reason exists for two components to actually collide (see
  // findOverlapIssues's own doc comment on why `layoutContentFit` prevents
  // it by construction), so any overlap finding here would be a real bug.
  //
  // `low-contrast` is deliberately *not* asserted zero here. Running the
  // matrix while developing this check surfaced genuine, pre-existing
  // sources of borderline-WCAG decorative/semantic colour that this task did
  // not introduce and was, at the time, out of scope to remediate (a
  // cross-cutting theme-polish pass, not "audit core") — documented in the
  // task report, and locked in as explicit regression tests right below this
  // block so the *specific*, understood cases stay understood rather than
  // silently allowlisted:
  //   1. `code.tsx`'s `LINE_NUM_COLOR` — a hardcoded editor-gutter gray.
  //   2. `architecture.tsx`'s layer title (`ctx.colors.primary` on
  //      `ctx.colors.panel ?? ctx.colors.surface`) — a *theme's own*
  //      internal colour pairing, not a hardcoded value; on `insight`
  //      specifically it computes to 4.40:1, essentially a rounding
  //      distance under the 4.5:1 body threshold.
  // Every one of these is a real (if minor/borderline) WCAG deviation an
  // advisory audit is *supposed* to surface — asserting them away would
  // defeat the point. None of them appear in `examples/basic.json` (the
  // plan's actual clean-deck gate, asserted above).
  //
  // Three former members of this list are gone: `kpi.tsx`'s hardcoded
  // delta-arrow red/green and `quote.tsx`'s decorative open-quote mark, as
  // of the bench-driven fix round's B-group (Task 3, both real defects, now
  // fixed via `accessibleInk` — see the "B-group ink fixes" describe block
  // below for that red→green re-pin), and `ending-banner-ending.tsx`/
  // `ending-rail-ending.tsx`'s former `COPYRIGHT_FAINT` orphan colour, as of
  // the contrast-policy wave's Task T1: that hardcoded per-file grey is gone
  // too, replaced by `metaInk(colors.muted, bg)` (`../render/ink`) tagged
  // `data-contrast-tier="meta"` — see `findContrastIssues — low-contrast`'s
  // own "meta" tests below for the mechanism, and `ink.test.ts`'s `metaInk`
  // describe block for the derivation itself. `metaInk` guarantees >=3:1
  // against the real rendered background on *any* theme (the fallback path
  // exists exactly for a theme where `colors.muted` alone wouldn't clear
  // it), so the `data-contrast-tier="meta"` marker alone is enough to keep
  // both sites off this list everywhere — on the two themes each layout
  // actually ships natively pinned to (consulting/banner-ending,

// Arc-bbox root fix, reclassification sweep: fixing `pathBoundingBox` (above)
// exposed a *real* defect the old bug had been masking, not just resolving
// false positives. `insight-panel.tsx`'s title and `roadmap.tsx`'s period
// text both render an unguarded `colors.accent` fill with no
// `accessibleInk` wrap — pre-fix, deck-audit.ts's `backgroundAt` resolved
// both against the accent bar's own bogus ~whole-card phantom region, whose
// fill is that exact same `colors.accent` value, so every theme scored a
// trivial ratio=1 "pass" (the benchmark-reported "insight_panel title
// renders 1:1 contrast across themes" symptom this task's brief named). A
// 13-theme sweep against the fixed bbox (run while building this fix, not
// asserted directly here — see the task report's reclassification table)
// found 8/13 themes' real (accent-on-`colors.surface`) pair genuinely fails
// 4.5:1. Fixed the same way `roadmap.tsx`'s own badge digit already was
// (`accessibleInk`, same file, established precedent) — these two tests are
// the red->green pin for that fix, using two of the eight affected themes.
