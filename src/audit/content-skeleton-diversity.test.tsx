// Content-layout expansion wave, task T3 (`.issues/2026-07-26-content-
// layouts/plan.md`) — the wave's own acceptance metric ("skeleton
// diversity"): with content-pool growth going from 10 to 12 layouts
// (`image-lead-split`/`split-band`, tasks T1/T2), does the pool actually
// read as more than ~4 distinct page skeletons for a fixed piece of content?
//
// **Corrected judgment (T1's own review flagged the original one
// defective).** The original proposal only measured the FIRST
// `data-audit-box` region's (x, y, width) — under that metric,
// `image-lead-split` looks like just another narrow single-column page: its
// text column is (96, ~190-260, 435) — x sits inside the pool's crowded
// x=96 cluster, and its width is only 197px narrower than the pool's
// previous floor (632px), 3px short of the 200px "clearly different"
// threshold an earlier review pass used informally. But that first box
// isn't this layout's actual novelty — the real new composition is the
// *second*, co-existing 613px visual column at x=571, which the
// first-box-only metric never looks at. **The metric was wrong, not the
// layout.** (See this suite's own "regression: first-box-only would
// under-count" test below, which pins this concretely rather than only
// narrating it.)
//
// Corrected judgment: resolve the FULL set of `data-audit-box` regions (not
// just the first) for a fixed IR, once per content layout. A page's
// "skeleton" = its region *count* plus each region's quantized (x, width)
// tuple — y is deliberately excluded from the fingerprint (spec's own
// wording: "y 允许浮动，它随标题行数变化") since a taller/shorter heading
// wrap shifts every region below it down without changing the page's actual
// composition. Assert the pool now resolves to >= 6 distinct skeleton
// classes (informally observed ~4 before this wave, using the old,
// first-box-only reading).

/**
 * Fixed input shape, applied identically to all current 19 layouts. T2's review
 * named `quiet-frame` as a layout whose own region set changes shape
 * with component *count* — its lone-non-full-body-component case narrows
 * and re-centers its content rect, full width otherwise — so "the region
 * set" is only a well-defined, comparable quantity once the input shape
 * feeding every layout is fixed and stated, not measured ad hoc per
 * layout).
 *
 * Chosen shape: exactly 2 components — a lead `image` (unresolved asset,
 * same "Image missing" placeholder path every layout's own image
 * handling already exercises, see `image.tsx`) followed by one short
 * `paragraph`. Deliberately not 0 or 1 component: `quiet-frame`'s own
 * single-narrowing branch only fires at exactly 1 *non-full-body* component,
 * and `stacked-poster`'s poster grammar (its own most differentiated region
 * shape — a `hero` + `strip`, not the flat degrade stack) only activates at
 * 1-2 *fitting* components — 0 or >=3 would silently degrade it back to the
 * same flat single-stack shape every other layout already has, hiding
 * exactly the kind of structural distinctiveness this metric exists to
 * measure. A scalable (image) lead is also required for `image-lead-split`
 * specifically: its visual column only gets a `data-audit-box` at all when
 * `components[0]` is a `SCALABLE_TYPES` member (see that file's own render
 * function) — the placeholder-fallback path draws a `data-audit-rect` but
 * deliberately no `data-audit-box` (nothing to scale-audit when there's no
 * real component behind it), so a non-image fixture would silently under-
 * count this layout's own region set the same way the rejected
 * first-box-only metric did, just via a different blind spot.
 *
 * Note: this shape does legitimately drop the paragraph on `narrow-column`
 * specifically (its column is wide enough that the image's own height
 * — `min(w*0.5, 340)` = 340px at 880px width — already consumes nearly all
 * of that layout's vertical budget, so `layoutContentFit`'s overflow
 * guard drops the second component rather than overflow the page). That's
 * `layoutContentFit` doing its job, not a fixture bug: a dropped component
 * renders no box at all, so it simply removes nothing this metric would
 * have counted — it does not distort any *rendered* region's geometry.
