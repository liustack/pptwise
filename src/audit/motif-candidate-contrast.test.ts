// P1 variety wave, task 2's own contrast-safety obligation (plan §任务 2:
// "对比度矩阵复跑（motif 换贴纸不得引入新对比度违例——若某候选在某主题背景
// 上违例，从该主题候选集剔除并记录）"). `full-matrix-contrast.test.ts`'s
// existing sweep already renders every theme's motif incidentally (whichever
// candidate that file's fixed implicit deck-content-hash seed happens to
// land on for pageKey "0") and passes — but that's one candidate per theme,
// not every one. This file exhaustively forces EVERY candidate in every
// multi-member `MOTIF_CANDIDATES` entry to render at least once per slide
// type, by brute-force searching a small seed for each (theme, candidate)
// pair that `resolveMotifId` actually resolves to it — deterministic once
// found (`findSeedFor` always returns the same seed for the same table), no
// flakiness. Single-member sets (`campaign`, `ink`) and `runway` (no motif)
// need no sweep here — they're already covered by
// `motif-selection.test.ts`'s byte-inertness block (always the theme's own
// pre-existing anchor, already exercised by the pre-P1 `full-matrix-
// contrast.test.ts` sweep every day since it was written).
//
// Wave 8 board lock (2026-08-22): consulting and enterprise, the last
// multi-member sets, are now single-member (`banner-motif` /
// `enterprise-motif`). `MULTI_CANDIDATE_THEMES` is therefore empty. The
// per-candidate contrast sweep and the decor-visibility loop skip on an
// empty array. The remaining job of this file is to nail that every
// registered set stays length 1, and that runway / museum / stage stay
// absent.
//
// Result of this sweep (recorded per 控制者裁决 §4's re-pin discipline, so a
// future reviewer doesn't have to re-derive "was this checked" from git
// blame): zero candidates removed. Every non-anchor candidate in
// `MOTIF_CANDIDATES` clears cover/chapter/content/ending on its adoptive
// theme's own backgrounds — expected, given every shared motif's "zero
// baked hex, colors from ctx" discipline (see `motif-selection.ts`'s own
// header for the two narrow documented exceptions, neither of which is
// reachable from this sweep — see that file's own comment).

// excludes every `<g data-decor>` shape from background candidacy (see that
// file's own "One more exclusion" doc comment), so a decor shape blending
// into its own background produces zero findings either way. That is
// exactly the bug the reviewer caught: `motif-banner-motif.tsx` /
// `motif-rail-motif.tsx`'s chapter branches hard-coded a pure-white fill
// tuned for their own anchor theme's dark chapter background — invisible
// white-on-white the moment `enterprise` (chapter bg `#FFFFFF`) or `journal`
// (chapter bg `#FAF7F2`) became candidates for them. Both are fixed
// (`readableOn(ctx.defaultBg ?? ctx.colors.bg)` instead of a literal — see
