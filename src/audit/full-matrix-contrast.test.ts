// @vitest-environment node
//
// Durable regression net for the W4 fix round (contrast defect class fixed
// in this task: layouts baking a text fill while assuming the theme's
// default background tone — see `../render/ink.ts`'s own header and the task
// report's "修复轮" section for the full defect family). Runs under the
// real Node platform (`installNodePlatform()`, same posture as
// `deck-audit.test.ts`) so `auditDeck`'s actual documented Node consumption
// path is exercised end-to-end.
//
// Scope: every canonical theme × every entry in that theme's v2 menu.
// Boundary pages contribute one entry each. Content contributes exactly the
// semantic kinds the theme offers. Each
// combination is rendered with `heading` populated on every slide type, plus
// `subheading` on `chapter`/`content` specifically — this task's defect
// class (and this task's own fix) lives on those two elements plus
// self-painted chapter-number watermarks/badges; `cover`/`ending`
// deliberately omit `subheading` — see below.
//
// Deliberately minimal otherwise — no `organization`/`date` meta, no
// `footnote`, no preceding chapter (so a content layout's section-label
// kicker never renders), no `kpi_cards`(+delta)/`code`/`quote`/
// `architecture` components, no `cover`/`ending` subheading. Every one of
// those was tried while building this test and each surfaces a *different*,
// pre-existing, cross-cutting issue unrelated to this task's defect class:
//   - `colors.muted` (the org/meta/footnote/kicker token nearly every
//     layout uses) used to be marginally under the 4.5:1 body floor
//     against several themes' own backgrounds — a theme-token-calibration
//     gap, not a layout assuming the wrong background. **Fixed** in a
//     later task (post-v0.3 W8 fix round, backlog item 5a —
//     `.issues/notes/engineering-history.md` #5 — a minimal
//     hue/saturation-preserving lightness recalibration across the 7
//     affected themes' `colors.muted`, see each `themes/<id>.ts`'s own
//     inline comment on that token) and locked in by the dedicated
//     `colors.muted contrast` describe block below, which measures the
//     real backgrounds this token actually renders against instead of this
//     file's own deliberately meta-free fixtures. Kept out of *this* sweep's
//     fixtures regardless, even post-fix — this sweep's own job is the W4
//     defect class (a layout assuming the wrong background for a token
//     it bakes), and adding meta/footnote content here would just
//     duplicate the dedicated block's coverage through a second, noisier
//     path instead of adding any.
//   - every `cover`/`ending` layout's *subheading/subtitle* also reads
//     `colors.muted` (unlike `chapter`/`content`, whose subheading uses
//     `colors.text`/`colors.accent`/`colors.primary` — the tokens this
//     task's own fix touches) — same token now covered by the fix and
//     dedicated block above, not a second gap.
//   - `cover-left-anchor.tsx`'s (and `cover-banner-title.tsx`'s)
//     multi-`<tspan>` author/date/version line: attribution **fixed** in a
//     later task (post-v0.3 backlog item 5b —
//     `.issues/notes/engineering-history.md` #5 — `findContrastIssues`
//     no longer drops a `<tspan>`'s owning `<text>`'s own x/y when the
//     tspan carries none of its own; see that function's own doc comment in
//     `deck-audit.ts` and the two dedicated regression tests in
//     `deck-audit.test.ts`); the `colors.muted` values that line renders
//     with are covered by the same fix/block as the two bullets above.
//     Still left out of *this* fixture regardless, to keep this sweep's own
//     scope narrow to the W4 defect class.
//   - the five sources `deck-audit.test.ts`'s own "understood pre-existing

    // fashion-chapter — 10 of 13; classroom/heritage excluded it via
    // `CHAPTER_WITHOUT_FASHION`) and **re-measured all 13/13** the same day

    // The watermark blend itself (`mixHex(accent, fg, 0.22)`) depends on

    // harmless token-value drift) without moving the ceiling anywhere close
    // to the 3:1 floor this whole entry is about staying under — both the
    // original and the re-measured 13-theme spread fit inside it unchanged,
    // so the numeric bounds themselves needed no adjustment. A finding
    // whose ratio lands outside [1.2, 1.8] no longer matches the

Unlike when this entry was first written, no theme curation-excludes fashion-chapter any more (post-v0.3 W8 fix round revoked the last three exclusions once their *heading* text — the actual failure — cleared 3:1 under the fixed `readableOn`) — this entry now covers all 13 themes' watermark uniformly.

The audit's own job here is finished the moment it stops reporting these as clean: before fix/decor-contrast-attribution it measured the ink cover's date at 5.44:1 against a page background the seal completely covers, where the real pairing is 1.07:1.

// `accessibleInk(colors.accent, ctx.defaultBg ?? colors.bg, fontSize)` in
// both `numbered-cards.tsx` and `quote.tsx` — were only proven against a
// content slide with *no* `slide.background` override, where `ctx.defaultBg`
// resolves straight to `themeDefaultBg` (`full-slide-svg.tsx`). Task 3's own
// review verified the same guard also holds on the *asset-scrim* branch (a
// content slide with `background: { kind: "asset", ... }`, where
// `ctx.defaultBg` instead flows through `resolveOverrideBackgroundHex`'s
// asset case — fixed in an earlier task, 03976da, to resolve to
// `paintedFallback`/`themeDefaultBg`, the color `background.tsx`'s
// auto-scrim actually paints, not `tokens.colors.surface`) across all 13
// themes — but only with throwaway, uncommitted probes, leaving this branch
// without a durable regression net. `paintedFallback` currently equals
// `themeDefaultBg` for every theme (see the two doc comments cited above),
// so this describe block's per-theme pass/fail outcomes are expected to
// match the plain-background block right above it byte-for-byte — the

//     non-text floor is the real bar there.
//   - 20px text — `kpi.tsx`'s and `content-bento-panel.tsx`'s delta arrow,

//     `colors.surface`. That wrapper never renders anything unreadable, so

//     disappears from the page. Hence the 4.5:1 floor on those two, asserted
//     through `accessibleInk` itself rather than a bare ratio, so the pin
//     tracks the calibration the renderer actually performs.
// `warning` is deliberately held to 3:1, not 4.5:1: no renderer paints it as
// text today, and several themes' caution tier is an amber whose 4.5:1
// weight on paper stock is a mud brown (pulse's own `警示褐` measures

/**
 * Per-classification meaning (each backed by reading the component's real
 * source — see the fix report for the full per-file audit trail):
 *
 * - `"no-muted-fill"`: never renders `colors.muted` as a `<text>`/`<tspan>`
 *   fill. Some of these *do* reference `colors.muted` in their source, but
 *   only as a `stroke` (e.g. `bullets.tsx`/`rings.tsx`/`comparison.tsx`'s
 *   own `colors.border ?? colors.muted` divider/rule fallback) —
 *   `findContrastIssues` only ever inspects `<text>`/`<tspan>` `fill`
 *   (`deck-audit.ts`'s `runContrastWalk`), so a stroke-only or wholly
 *   absent usage can never itself produce a `low-contrast` finding,
 *   regardless of calibration.
 * - `"page-bg"`: renders `colors.muted` text, but always directly over the
 *   ambient slide background (no component-painted rect/path sits behind
 *   it) — already covered by the "clears 4.5:1 against every real
 *   cover/content/ending page background" check above, which is a pure
 *   function of the two hex values and doesn't care which component
 *   painted the text on top.
 * - `"flat-surface"`: renders `colors.muted` text over a card/panel whose
 *   fill is the *same*, unblended `colors.surface` token the bento-panel
 *   check above already locks (`icon-cards.tsx`/`kpi.tsx`'s card shell/
 *   `roadmap.tsx`'s card/`insight-panel.tsx`'s panel/`row-cards.tsx`'s
 *   card/`steps.tsx`'s horizontal-mode card/`image*.tsx`'s missing-asset
 *   placeholder rect all use `fill={ctx.colors.surface}` verbatim, grepped
 *   and read individually) — re-rendering would just re-verify the
 *   identical (muted, surface) hex pair the bento-panel block already
 *   exercises, since contrast is a pure function of the two colors, not of
 *   which component drew them.
 * - `"needs-fixture"`: a real, distinct (fill, background) pair not
 *   covered by either of the above — has its own dedicated probe below.
 * - `"known-gap"`: a real, `auditDeck`-confirmed low-contrast finding this
 *   task's token-calibration discipline cannot close — recorded (pinned),
 *   not silently exempted, in its own dedicated describe block (a future
 *   instance needs a new one — the two `kpi_cards`/`numbered_cards` cases
 *   that originally justified this category were fixed post-v0.3 W8, see
 *   the "colors.muted opacity-blend fix" describe block below, which pins
 *   their resolved, zero-affected-themes state rather than the shortfall,
 *   and reclassified out of `"known-gap"`, so no current entry uses this
 *   value — see commit c523994 for the shape a from-scratch pin took).

// band never becomes a `paintedShapes` background candidate (preventing a
// *false positive*), which also means the SVG-level walk can never resolve
// a label's background to anything but the plain page bg, and `--pixels`
// can't help either (verified directly: that layer only ever samples runs
// whose SVG-resolved background came back `null`, and this one resolves
// cleanly — non-null — to the page bg). This describe block is the
// permanent, renderer-output-level regression net the review ordered: it
// reads the REAL rendered SVG (`renderSlideSvg`, the same single-source
// markup the exporter and preview both use) — a band's real fill/geometry
// off its own `data-band-bbox` attribute, a label's real ink/geometry off
// its own `data-label-bbox` — and independently recomputes the analytic
// alpha-composite blend for every band a label's box geometrically
// overlaps, asserting every resulting ratio still clears the WCAG floor.
// A label backed by a safety chip (`data-label-chip`, the opposite-
// direction-conflict escalation `sankey.tsx`'s own `isSafeAgainstAll` doc
// comment names) is verified against the *chip's* real fill instead of any
// band blend — the chip is what a viewer actually sees behind that label.
//
// Pre-fix, this exact method (analytic blend + real geometric overlap)
// reproduced the review's own measured violations on this branch's HEAD

// helper this codebase already built for exactly this shape of problem
// ("a dimmed ink tier can drop under the floor even when the same ink at
// full opacity clears it comfortably", that function's own doc comment)
// and already wired up at its two existing call sites
// (`chapter-banner-chapter.tsx`/`chapter-rail-chapter.tsx`) — but, until
// this fix, never at these two:
//   - kpi.tsx's row-card `source` line: `fill={colors.muted}
//     fillOpacity={0.7}`. Every raw (fill, background) pair this file
//     checks already clears 4.5:1 post-recalibration, but blending muted at
//     0.7 alpha toward `colors.surface` pulled the *effective* color close
//     enough to the background that all 13 themes failed.
//   - numbered-cards.tsx's `sub` line: `fill={colors.muted}
//     opacity={0.75}`. Same mechanism, 12/13 themes failed (campaign's
//     post-matrix-recalibration muted had already moved light enough to
//     clear even the 0.75-blended case, a side effect, not a targeted fix).
// This was first recorded rather than fixed (commit c523994) after
// evaluating and rejecting a recalibrate-the-hex-instead approach:
// independently computed, the 4 themes with *no other* colors.muted issue
// at all (academic/classroom/tech/journal) would still need to darken
// ~16-19 percentage points of lightness to clear kpi.tsx's source line at
// 0.7 alpha — an order of magnitude past every adjustment either
// recalibration round made (max 8.7pp, campaign) — landing muted's own raw
// contrast around 11:1 against its card surface, next to colors.text's own
// ~16-17:1 there. That stops reading as a *softer* secondary tier at all —
// the exact invariant this token's calibration exists to protect.
//
// Fixed here instead: both call sites now route through
// `accessibleOpacity(colors.muted, <real background>, <real rendered
// fontSize>, <preferred opacity>)` — `colors.surface` for kpi.tsx (the
// row-card's own shell), `ctx.defaultBg ?? ctx.colors.bg` for
// numbered-cards.tsx (no card, sits on the page background like its `text`
// field). Confirmed by measurement, not assumed: `accessibleOpacity` falls
// back to full opacity for every theme whose blended ratio missed 4.5:1 —
// all 13/13 for kpi.tsx, 12/13 for numbered-cards.tsx (campaign keeps its
// preferred 0.75, already clearing the floor there without falling back) —
// exactly the blast radius this comment's predecessor predicted when it
// deferred the fix. `findsMuted` below (unchanged) now finds zero affected
// themes for either call site. The two assertions were flipped from pinning
// the pre-fix shortfall to locking the post-fix floor, not deleted, so a

// with a real asset background (a data-URI `<image>`, not the missing-asset
// placeholder rect) through the real `auditDeck` pipeline.

// a non-takeover asset background's auto-scrim — applies identically to
// both slide types, see `full-slide-svg.tsx`'s own "content/ending 的 asset
// 背景维持 P1 雾面 scrim" comment): grepping every `ctx.defaultBg`/

// `ending` sweep here would render successfully but could never actually
// exercise the fixed code path — indistinguishable from a vacuous check.
// `resolveOverrideBackgroundHex`'s own direct unit tests
// (`full-slide-svg.test.tsx`) cover the `asset` branch regardless of which
// slide type calls it, so the fix itself is not undertested for `ending` —
// only this particular real-render net is narrowed to where it can actually
// discriminate today. A future `ending` layout that starts reading

// Decor-collision sweep (fix/decor-contrast-attribution). The sweep at the
// top of this file renders no `meta.organization`/`meta.date` — a deliberate
// scope choice, argued in this file's own header — and a theme motif's corner
// shapes land almost exclusively under exactly that meta band. So the
// defect this fix closes was invisible to every net in this file: a motif's
// solid corner square sitting under the cover date, with the audit reporting
// the *page background* the square covers instead of the square.
//
// Scoped by attribution rather than by hand-picked theme/layout pairs: a
// finding counts here only when the background it resolved to is a fill that
// appears inside this page's `<g data-decor>` subtree and nowhere on its
// content layer. That is exactly the set of verdicts this fix newly makes
// possible, so the block cannot drift into re-litigating the meta-line
// contrast family the file header already excludes (measured: 41 findings on
// a meta-populated sweep, none of them decor-attributed, all of them
// pre-existing and unrelated).
//
// Three deck hashes rather than one — the default plus explicit seeds 0 and 1
// — because `resolveMotifId` picks a different motif per hash and a theme's
// corner ornament is only present on some rolls. Not an exhaustive motif
// sweep (that is `motif-candidate-contrast.test.ts`'s job); enough to keep
// more than one theme's collision under a regression net.
