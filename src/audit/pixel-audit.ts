 * Optional pixel-level contrast audit (audit-v2 phase B, spec §4.3) — the
 * one pixel blind spot the deterministic SVG audit can't see: text painted
 * directly over a bare or too-faintly-scrimmed `<image>`, where
 * `deck-audit.ts`'s own SVG-color walk correctly gives up rather than guess
 * (`ImageBackedTextRun`, `__collectImageBackedTextRuns`). Never imported by
 * `deck-audit.ts` at the top level — `auditDeck`'s `pixels: true` branch
 * reaches this module through a lazy `import("./pixel-audit")` instead
 * (that function's own doc comment explains why: this file statically
 * depends on `deck-audit.ts` for its shared primitives, so a *static*
 * import the other way would form a module cycle; nothing here needs to be
 * loaded at all for the far more common `pixels` left unset case).
 *
 * Flow per spec §4.3, steps 2-6:
 * 1. `__collectImageBackedTextRuns` — reuse the exact same background-
 *    resolution walk the deterministic audit already ran, just reading its
 *    "could not resolve" runs instead of discarding them. A page with none
 *    skips rasterization entirely (no rasterizer call, no risk of that
 *    page's own remote-asset guard ever firing) — real cost only where
 *    there is real work to do.
 * 2. `stripTextNodes` — the "去文字克隆" clone.
 * 3. `rasterizeSvg(stripped, 1280, 720)` — platform primitive (Sharp in
 *    Node, native canvas in a browser — see `resolveRasterizer`).
 * 4/5. `worstCaseSample` — grid-sample each run's estimated box against the
 *    rasterized pixels, tracking the least-favorable (lowest-ratio) point.
 * 6. Only a sample below `PIXEL_HARD_FINDING_MAX_RATIO` becomes a finding —
 *    spec §4.3's own anti-false-positive gate, see that constant's doc
 *    comment.
