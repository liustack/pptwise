/**
 * Version stamping for every place that names a version: the skill launchers
 * and the pinned install commands in the docs.
 *
 * The dsh install command must name a version: dsh installs plugins through
 * pnpm 11, which holds back anything published in the last 24 hours and
 * silently resolves `@latest` against what survives that filter, so `@latest`
 * hands a new reader an old release. A pinned version goes stale instead, and
 * this module is the fix: `pnpm release:version` rewrites every pinned
 * `@liustack/pptwise@x.y.z` occurrence in the repo's markdown to the current
 * package.json version, and the drift test (scripts/stamp.test.mts) reads the
 * same occurrences back and asserts each one matches. Keeping the read and
 * the write in one module is what keeps the two in step.
 *
 * Markdown files are discovered by scanning rather than by a fixed list, so a
 * new doc with a pinned command is covered the day it appears. The launchers
 * (`skills/pptwise/scripts/run.sh` and `run.ps1`) carry the same version in a
 * shell and a PowerShell constant, and matter more than any doc line: the
 * pinned version there is what actually runs when a harness invokes the skill
 * without a `pptwise` on PATH. They are stamped by exact line pattern.
