/** Preflight gate for the *installed* pptwise DSH plugin.

 *  Everything here runs against the copy under `~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/

 *  a release actually hands to DSH.
 *
 *  The gate used to check one thing — that the skill registers and points at
 *  its packaged CLI — while the plugin had grown three more halves: a tool, an
 *  HTTP route, and a browser bundle. Deleting any of those left the gate green,
 *  which is the failure mode a preflight exists to prevent. Each section below
 *  is therefore written so that removing the feature it covers turns the gate
 *  red, and each was proven that way by breaking the plugin on purpose.
