Every theme now says which cover it wants. Ten themes gain or extend a cover
preference.

**Covers change on decks that don't pin one — read this with the ink note.**
0.21 moves the cover slot for two reasons that land together. The ink redesign
added a ninth cover layout to the shared pool, which changes the denominator
the seeded picker samples from, so a fixed seed can land somewhere new even
though no existing layout changed. This change is the one that gives the move a
reason: themes that previously expressed no cover preference now express one,
so the picker leans where the theme's own design points. Measured on a fixed
deck across 17 themes × 40 seeds, **351 of 680 cover picks move**, all of them
on the ten themes listed below. **No page other than the cover moves for
any theme**, and no content is dropped, reflowed or truncated by either pass.
Pin `slide.layout` on a cover to hold it exactly.

The ten whose covers move: `enterprise` and `campaign` toward the diagonal
split, `classroom` toward the quiet adaptive header, `luxe` toward
the full-bleed masthead, `heritage` toward the double-ruled editorial masthead,
`terra` toward a left anchor, `ember` toward the diagonal split, `insight`
toward the editorial masthead and `vermilion` toward the tone-adaptive header.
`consulting`, `academic`, `ink`, `tech`, `runway`, `journal` and `pulse` pick
exactly what they picked before. Four checked-in example previews were
re-recorded and every one shows only a different cover layout.

Because the theme, narrative and beat preferences combine by taking the
strongest rather than by multiplying, a theme that names only covers the active
narrative already favors adds nothing at all. `insight` and `vermilion` shipped
that way in this branch's first pass and are corrected here: `insight` now also
leans toward the double-ruled editorial masthead, `vermilion` toward the
tone-adaptive header, and both are visible to a deck that names no narrative.
A test now holds every theme to it, so a future preference that would flatten to
nothing fails at build time instead of shipping silently.
