# pptpress benchmark

A model-agnostic evaluation of how well a model follows `skills/pptpress/SKILL.md` to turn a
plain-English deck request into a working pptpress artifact. Zero API calls, zero model
dependency: this directory is a fixed question bank plus a run protocol. Scoring (Task 2 of
this wave) is entirely mechanical — it consumes the artifact files a model produces, never the
model itself, and applies no subjective quality dimension.

`tests/bench/` is tracked in git but excluded from the published npm package — see "Package
exclusion" below.

## Directory layout

```
tests/bench/
  questions/q01..q20/
    prompt.md   the request handed to the model-under-test, verbatim
    meta.json   coverage annotation — never shown to the model, descriptive only
    assets/     optional — local files an image_deck question's prompt claims are attached
                (round-2 addition, see "Question bank schema" below)
  results/<model-tag>/<question-id>/
    ...         the model-under-test's artifact (created by a run, not checked in here)
    meta.json   optional self-reported run stats (tokens/duration/model), pass-through only
  results-probe/<model-tag>/<question-id>/   probe-bank runs (see "Probe bank" below)
  results-archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>/              kept snapshots of a past run, for cross-round comparison
  README.md     this file
```

Every run-output directory matches one `.gitignore` rule (`tests/bench/results*/`) — runs are
regenerable and never checked in. Keep a round worth comparing against by moving it into
`results-archive/<date>/` rather than leaving it in place, so the next run starts clean and the
scorer (which reads `<resultsDir>/<model-tag>/`) never mistakes an archive folder for a model tag.

## Run protocol

For each question:

1. Give the model-under-test exactly two things: `skills/pptpress/SKILL.md` and that question's
   `prompt.md`. Nothing else — no `meta.json`, no other question's prompt, no hints about which
   component or layout the question is aiming at.
2. Let the model run the SKILL's workflow to completion: narrative/theme choice, spec (or a
   direct bare IR file for a small deck, per the SKILL's own "skip the spec" allowance),
   `pages/*.json`, `assemble`, `validate`, `render`, `audit` — whatever phases the model
   actually reaches.
3. Save the resulting artifact into `tests/bench/results/<model-tag>/<question-id>/`:
   - a bare IR file (any `.json` filename), or
   - a full deck project directory (`deck.spec.json` + `pages/` + optional `assets/`), for
     questions that asked for the spec-then-fill workflow.
4. Optionally drop a `meta.json` alongside it with self-reported `{ tokens?, duration_seconds?,
   model? }`. This is passed through into reports verbatim — it is never scored, never used to
   adjust any pass/fail outcome.

**Hard rule: no manual touch-ups after generation.** Whatever the model produced on its own is
what gets scored — no hand-editing a `pages/*.json` to fix a `validate` error, no re-running a
single failed step in isolation after inspecting the failure, no swapping in a better asset.
First-shot quality under the SKILL's own self-check loop (the model's own `validate`/`audit`
iterations, run by the model itself as part of its normal workflow) is the thing this benchmark
measures — a human correcting the output after the fact would measure the human, not the model.

### Harness role

The harness plays the user for any turn where the model-under-test stops and waits on a human
reply. `skills/pptpress/SKILL.md` Phase 2 asks the model to propose a spec and confirm it before
writing page content — a single-shot harness has no human to supply that confirmation, so the
harness scripts it instead, with exactly two fixed lines, used verbatim:

- If the model-under-test's turn is asking for confirmation of a spec it just proposed (the
  Phase 2 "propose and confirm" gate), reply: `Spec confirmed, proceed.`
- For any other clarifying question the model asks, reply: `Proceed with your best judgment.`

Both lines are fixed and verbatim across every harness implementation and every question — no
paraphrasing, no tailoring to the specific question, no improvised detail. This scripted
exchange is part of the standard run protocol, not a manual touch-up: it stands in for the one
human turn the SKILL's own workflow expects, injected mechanically rather than by a person
reading the model's output and deciding how to respond. The five deck-project questions (q03,
q06, q08, q13, q17) additionally tell the model directly, inside the prompt itself, that its
plan is pre-approved once it validates (the prompts' own wording — plain-English "plan", not the
schema term — left as written per this file's "prompts stay untouched" discipline), so a harness
with no scripted-reply turn at all (a true single-shot, no-second-message harness) still gets a
runnable question.

## Question bank schema (`meta.json`)

```jsonc
{
  "id": "q01",
  "title": "Q2 Budget Performance Review",
  "coverage": {
    "strategy": "pyramid",          // one of the 5 narrative strategies (src/narrative)
    "pacing": "spacious",           // one of the 3 pacing tiers
    "expects_components": ["kpi_cards", "waterfall", "verdict_banner"],
    "workflow": "bare-ir",          // "bare-ir" | "deck-project" — which path the prompt asks for
    "image_deck": false             // true if the prompt attaches image material
  },
  "lang": "en"                      // "en" | "zh"
}
```

`coverage` is descriptive annotation only, consumed by the scorer's `coverageHits` reporting
(Task 2). It never penalizes a model for landing on a different component or layout than
`expects_components` names — a model that solves the same brief with an equally valid component
choice is not wrong. `workflow` and `image_deck` are additive fields beyond the wave brief's
base shape, added so the scorer can report the deck-project-workflow and image-asset coverage
cells without re-deriving them from prompt text.

### `assets/` (optional, round-2 addition)

A question directory whose `meta.json` sets `coverage.image_deck: true` may also carry an
`assets/` subdirectory of real local image files matching what the prompt's own "Materials"
section describes (subject, count — filenames are the question author's choice, the prompt never
promises a specific one). Most questions have no `assets/` directory at all — the field is
optional, and its absence is not itself meaningful (a `bare-ir` question with no attached material
has nothing to provision). `q02`/`q12`/`q15` are the first questions to use it: round 1
(`.issues/notes/2026-08-04-bench-first-agentic.md`) found the agentic harness's empty workspace
left these three questions' models with nothing real to point an image reference at — they either
invented a file path that doesn't exist or tried to write a placeholder PNG by hand through the
text-only `write_file` tool, landing a zero-byte or corrupt file (`resolveLocalAssets`,
`src/cli/load-ir.ts`, rejects both). `run-agentic.mts`'s `copyQuestionAssets` copies this directory
into the model's workspace before round 1 (see "Agentic API run mode" below) so a real file is
there to reference instead. `prompt.md` itself is never edited to add or explain this — the file's
mere presence in the workspace is what changes, not the request's wording (this file's own
"answer-leak discipline" / "no manual touch-ups" posture extends to "no touching the prompt to
compensate for a harness gap").

## Answer-leak discipline

No `prompt.md` names a pptpress component type, layout id, or narrative/schema vocabulary word
(`swot`, `bmc`, `gantt`, `waterfall`, `roadmap`, `matrix`, `timeline`, `bullets`, `kpi_cards`,
`asset_id`, `layout`, `narrative`, `pyramid`/`storytelling`/`instructional`/`showcase`/`briefing`,
etc.). Every question is written as a working business ask in plain language — a strategy
question describes strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats sitting together on one slide, a
schedule question describes dated bars sharing one calendar axis — the same shape the SKILL's
own component-selection table maps to a specific type, without the prompt ever naming that type.
`coverage.expects_components` in `meta.json` is the only place the real component ids appear,
and `meta.json` is never handed to the model-under-test (see run protocol above).

## Scoring (`tests/bench/score.mts`)

```
pnpm bench:score [questionsDir] [resultsDir]
# defaults to `tests/bench/questions` / `tests/bench/results`, both resolved against cwd
```

Walks `<resultsDir>/<model-tag>/<question-id>/` for every model directory found, scores each
question in the fixed `<questionsDir>` question bank against it, and writes:

- a per-model `<resultsDir>/<model-tag>/report.md` — one row per question plus an aggregates
  section
- a cross-model `<resultsDir>/summary.md` — one row per model (pass rates, mean findings,
  determinism rate), sorted alphabetically by model tag

Every metric is purely mechanical, computed off the SDK the render chain already exposes
(`validateIr`/`auditDeck`/`generatePptx`, `src/index.ts`):

- **validate first-pass**: does the produced artifact (or its assembled IR, for a deck project —
  read via `readDeckDir`, `src/cli/deck-dir.ts`, the same seam `pptpress validate`/`render` use)
  pass `validateIr` — pass/fail plus the raw error count
- **audit findings**: `auditDeck` finding count (overflow, out-of-bounds, low-contrast, overlap, plus the advisory content-truncated and content-dropped codes — all six count) —
  only computed when validate passed (an invalid IR has nothing well-formed enough to audit)
- **render success**: does `generatePptx` produce a well-formed `.pptx` without throwing
- **determinism**: render the same artifact twice and compare the two `.pptx` files byte for
  byte via `normalizedPptxSha1` (`tests/bench/score.mts`), with the one known clock-dependent exclusion
  the render chain already carries — `docProps/core.xml` (pptxgenjs bakes
  `new Date().toISOString()` into it on every call — same exclusion the `normalizedZipMap`
  precedent in `src/pptx/generate-notes-export.test.ts` establishes). Every other zip part is
  read as a binary buffer (not a lossy UTF-8-decoded string) and hashed — a genuine byte
  comparison, including embedded binary image assets, not a structural or stringified diff.
  `null` when the render itself failed (nothing to compare)
- **coverage hits**: which of `meta.json`'s `expects_components` actually appear in the
  produced IR's top-level `slides[].components[].type` — reported for a human reader, never fed
  back into `validatePass`/`renderOk`/any other pass-fail decision

**Validate semantics changed 2026-07-21** (borrow wave, Task 2 — `validateIr` dual-threshold
severity recalibration, `src/api.ts`): `ok`/`errors` now reflect only error-severity
`checkIrQuality` findings (an empty deck, a bullet item past the render-safety ceiling) — the
editorial-budget findings (missing/long heading, density, bullets count/length) moved to a
separate `warnings` array and no longer fail `ok`. `validatePass`/`validateErrorCount` above read
straight off `v.ok`/`v.errors.length` and never inspected `checkIrQuality` severity directly, so
`score.mts` needed no code change — "only an error counts as a validate fail" already matches the
new semantics automatically. Cross-round comparability note: a `report.md`/`summary.md` generated
before this date used the pre-recalibration semantics (any content-quality finding, warn or
error, failed `validatePass`), so a `validatePass` rate from before this date is not directly
comparable to one from after — some answers that used to fail purely on an editorial finding
(no structural or render-safety problem) now pass.

A missing result directory, malformed JSON, an ambiguous artifact (more than one candidate `.json`
file), or a `readDeckDir`/`assembleDeck` structural error scores as a fail for that question with
a `reason` in the report's notes column, without aborting the rest of the batch. Self-reported
`meta.json` (`{ tokens?, duration_seconds?, model? }`, run protocol step 4) passes through into
the report's `tokens`/`duration_s` columns verbatim when present, blank otherwise — never scored.
Both `report.md` files and `summary.md` are byte-identical across two scoring runs of the same
result set — no timestamps or other non-deterministic content in the report body.

## Testing the scorer

`tests/bench/score.test.ts` (vitest, run by `pnpm check` like every other suite) exercises the scorer
against `tests/bench/fixtures/`: `tests/bench/fixtures/questions/{fx01,fx02,fx03}` (a 3-question fixture bank,
one bare-IR question, one deck-project question, one audit-sensitive question) scored against
`tests/bench/fixtures/results/green-model/` (all three questions validate clean, audit clean, render
deterministically) and `tests/bench/fixtures/results/degraded-model/` (one malformed-JSON artifact, one
validate-failing IR — an unknown theme id, one validate-clean but audit-positive IR — a real
low-contrast finding from `luxe` theme + `kpi_cards` `delta: "down"`, the same source
`src/svg/audit/deck-audit.test.ts` pins). The suite asserts exact metric values per fixture
question, report shape, and — the scorer-reproducibility requirement — that two independent
`runScoring` calls over the same fixture tree produce byte-identical report content, plus a
`normalizedPptxSha1` unit suite proving the determinism hash both ignores a
`docProps/core.xml`-only difference and is sensitive to any other single-byte change (text or
binary), so the double-run assertion is a genuine byte comparison rather than a vacuous
always-equal check.

Two more `loadArtifact` failure branches, standalone `fx97`/`fx98` results not part of the
3-question fixture bank (same pattern as the `fx99` "missing directory" fixture — kept out of
`tests/bench/fixtures/questions` so they don't shift the bank's aggregate counts), are also covered: a
deck-project directory whose `pages/p-cover.json` redeclares the spec-locked `heading` field
(`readDeckDir`/`assembleDeck` structural-assembly failure), and a result directory with two
candidate `*.json` files (the "ambiguous artifact" branch). Both score as a fail with a `reason`,
never a thrown exception. Every `reason`/error string that would otherwise embed an absolute
filesystem path is rewritten repo-root-relative before it reaches the report's `notes` column
(`relativizeToRepoRoot` in `score.mts`) — same-machine byte-identical reproducibility never
depended on this, but it also makes two reports from two different checkouts of the same fixture
tree comparable.

## Package exclusion

`package.json`'s `files` whitelist is `["dist", "README.zh-CN.md"]` — `tests/bench/` is not listed, so
`npm pack` never includes it. Verified by running `npm pack --dry-run` from the repo root and
confirming no `tests/bench/` entry appears in the file list it prints.

## Single-shot API run mode (`run.mts`)

The second sanctioned run mode next to the agentic protocol above: `pnpm bench:run <prefix> [qids...]` drives an external OpenAI-compatible model through ONE completion per question — the prompt carries SKILL.md, the live vocabulary (`schema` / `narratives --json` / `themes --json`), and the question, and the model must answer with a bare IR JSON document. No tool loop, no self-check iterations, so this measures first-shot floor quality (stricter than agentic mode — expect lower validate pass rates). Credentials come from the repo-root `.env` (gitignored): `<PREFIX>_BASE_URL` / `<PREFIX>_API_KEY` / `<PREFIX>_MODEL`. Artifacts land in `tests/bench/results/<model>/<qid>/` with `meta.json` recording `mode: "single-shot"`, so `score.mts` consumes both modes identically — compare runs of the same mode against each other, not across modes.

`run.mts` also takes optional `--questions-dir=<dir>` / `--results-dir=<dir>` flags (default: `tests/bench/questions` / `tests/bench/results`, unchanged) so a second question bank — the probe bank below — can be run without touching the main bank's result history: `pnpm bench:run <prefix> --questions-dir=tests/bench/questions-probe --results-dir=tests/bench/results-probe`. Question ids are auto-discovered from whichever `questionsDir` is in effect (`/^[a-z]\d\d$/`, matches both `q01`- and `p01`-style ids). `score.mts` already took `[questionsDir] [resultsDir]` positional args before this wave (`pnpm bench:score tests/bench/questions-probe tests/bench/results-probe`) — no scorer code changed for the probe bank.

**`--model=<id>` override** (round 2, `.issues/2026-08-04-bench-agentic/dashscope-cache-investigation.md`): runs an existing prefix's credentials against a different model id for this run only, e.g. `pnpm bench:run qwen --model=qwen-flash` to test a dashscope-cache-eligible model without adding a whole new `.env` prefix. The result directory tag is the actual model id used (`cfg.model` doubles as the tag `run.mts` already writes results under), so an override never mixes into the un-overridden prefix's own result tree, and the self-reported `meta.json`'s `model` field reflects whichever id was actually queried.

**Image questions in single-shot mode — no asset provisioning, unchanged.** `run.mts` has no file-access tools at all (see the run-protocol table above) — the model's only way to reference `q02`/`q12`/`q15`'s attached photography is to copy the `data:image/png;base64,...` URI straight out of the prompt's own "Materials" section into `assets.images[id].src`, which the injected prompt already carries verbatim. Reading the round-1 archive (`tests/bench/results-archive/2026-08-04-first-full-agentic/`) confirms both outcomes actually happen: several answers do copy the data URI correctly (a working, if verbose, first-shot answer), while others instead reference a plausible-looking local file path (e.g. `"assets/team-photo.png"`) that was never provisioned anywhere — `score.mts` resolves that path against the result directory and finds nothing there, so that answer fails on `renderOk` for a reason unrelated to its actual IR quality. This is a real, pre-existing gap in single-shot mode, but round 2's fix is agentic-only: `run.mts` gives the model no tool to discover or reference a provisioned `assets/` directory even if one existed, so provisioning one here would go unused. Left as documented, known behavior rather than silently "fixed" by a change that couldn't actually help.

## Agentic API run mode (`run-agentic.mts`)

The full implementation of the agentic protocol described above (BENCH-01,
`.issues/2026-08-03-bench-agentic/plan.md`): `pnpm bench:agentic <prefix> [qids...]` drives an
external OpenAI-compatible model through a real function-calling tool loop instead of one
completion. The model gets four tools — `write_file(path, content)`, `read_file(path)`,
`list_files(path?)`, `run_pptpress(args)` — and a private per-question workspace, and iterates on
its own: write IR (or deck-project files), run `validate`/`audit` via `run_pptpress`, read the
findings, fix, repeat, the same self-check loop the SKILL playbook describes, with real tool
access instead of imagined output. Credentials use the same `.env` shape as `run.mts`:
`<PREFIX>_BASE_URL` / `<PREFIX>_API_KEY` / `<PREFIX>_MODEL`. Same `--model=<id>` override as
`run.mts` (see that section above for the motivating case) — when given, the result model-tag
below is derived from the override id, not the prefix.

**Asset provisioning for image questions** (round 2, fixes 3 of round 1's failures). A question
directory's optional `assets/` subdirectory (see "Question bank schema" above) is copied into the
model's private workspace before round 1 (`copyQuestionAssets`) — real files a model can point a
relative `assets.images[id].src` at instead of inventing a path or hand-writing a broken
placeholder through the text-only `write_file` tool. The system prompt mentions this mechanically
("the actual referenced files are already present in your workspace... check with list_files")
without describing what any specific question's material actually shows — the model still has to
look. After the run, `placeArtifact` copies a bare-IR answer's sibling `assets/` directory (the
same directory the model's own `run_pptpress validate`/`render` calls resolved against during the
tool loop) up into the result root alongside `deck.json`, mirroring what it already did for a
deck-project answer's `assets/` — otherwise a correctly-authored local-path reference would
validate and render fine inside the tool loop but then fail `score.mts`'s own re-render, which
resolves the same relative path against the result root, not the workspace.

The system prompt also explicitly warns the model not to call `write_file` on a path already
under `assets/` — added after the round-2 smoke (q12, QWEN) showed the provisioning path working
exactly as designed (a real file copied into the workspace, discovered via `list_files`) but the
model then "helpfully" overwrote that real PNG by `write_file`-ing the literal base64 text it saw
in the prompt into the same path, corrupting it (`write_file` writes whatever text it is given
verbatim — it has no way to decode base64 into real binary bytes). This is a model-behavior gap
the added prompt line mitigates, not a harness defect — the copy, path-safety, and result-placement
mechanics all worked; see the round-2 task report for the full smoke trace.

**No pre-injected vocabulary.** Unlike `run.mts`'s single-shot prompt (SKILL + schema +
narratives + themes, because that model has no tools and injection is its only access to any of
it), this runner's system prompt carries only SKILL.md and the question — the IR JSON Schema,
narrative presets, and theme catalog are not embedded. The model queries them itself via
`run_pptpress(["schema"])` / `run_pptpress(["narratives", "--json"])` /
`run_pptpress(["themes", "--json"])`, exactly what this file's own run protocol above and the
SKILL playbook already describe. This is the largest cost lever on this runner (the injected
vocabulary alone was most of an ~83k-token system prompt) and is more protocol-faithful, not a
compromise — the protocol never asked for pre-injection in a mode where the model can just ask.

**Tool-result cap.** Every tool result (a `read_file`, `list_files`, or `run_pptpress` return
value) is capped at 8000 characters before it goes back to the model, truncated from the end so
the head — where a CLI's error message or summary line lives — survives intact. An over-cap
result gets a trailing marker line stating what was cut, e.g.
`[truncated: 8000 of 41203 chars shown]`. Applies uniformly to every tool and every question, no
per-question tuning.

**Tool surface — minimal and neutral by design.** No general shell. `run_pptpress` only accepts a
whitelisted, read-only/artifact-producing subcommand (`render`, `validate`, `audit`,
`asset-brief`, `schema`, `assemble`, `disassemble`, `migrate`, `themes`, `narratives`, `preview`,
`spec validate`) — no `serve` (interactive), no removed vocabulary-v4 aliases (`plan`,
`scenarios`), no `check-update`/`self-update` (network side effects with no benchmark value).
Every path argument to every tool is resolved against the workspace and rejected if it is an
absolute path or escapes the workspace via `..` — symlink-based escapes are not checked (out of
scope: the workspace is a harness-created scratch directory the model itself populates, not
attacker-controlled input). This keeps the benchmark measuring the model's fit with the SKILL
rather than the harness's own cleverness.

**Round cap.** 48 chat-completion calls per question (raised from 32 for round 2 —
`.issues/notes/2026-08-04-bench-first-agentic.md`: round 1 hit the 32-round cap on 8 of 40
deepseek runs and 7 of 40 qwen runs, concentrated in the five deck-project questions
q03/q06/q08/q13/q17, whose five-phase spec→pages→assemble→validate→render workflow eats rounds
faster than a single bare-IR file — those runs' half-finished artifacts scored as failures purely
from running out of budget, not from producing wrong content) — one round may contain several tool
calls, they all count as one round. The cap is fixed across every question and model in a given
batch (never tuned per-question or per-model — a cap tight enough to clip real runs would measure
budget, not capability, `run-agentic.mts`'s own `ROUND_CAP` doc comment states this as the
constant's governing philosophy). Hitting the cap stops the run with `cap_hit: true` in
`meta.json`; whatever the model wrote up to that point is left in place, same as a natural stop.
The system prompt's own stated turn budget is interpolated straight from the `ROUND_CAP` constant
(fixed 2026-08-03 after a first raise updated the constant and this README but missed the
hardcoded number inside the prompt string itself, `46bcd1b`) — the two can no longer drift apart.
A model turn that makes no tool calls is classified as a spec-confirmation question, some other
clarifying question, or a genuine stop — the harness answers the first two with the run protocol's
two fixed scripted lines above and ends the run on the third.

**`meta.json` is harness-written, never model-self-reported** — the 2026-07-20 archived round
found model-reported identity untrustworthy, so this harness records what it actually asked for
and what the API actually returned, side by side, without reconciling them:

```jsonc
{
  "provider_prefix": "QWEN",
  "base_url_host": "dashscope.aliyuncs.com",
  "model_requested": "qwen3.6-27b",      // the .env <PREFIX>_MODEL value asked for
  "model_reported": ["qwen3.6-27b-..."], // the `model` field the API echoed back, per round, deduped
  "mode": "agentic",
  "rounds": 7,
  "tool_calls": 12,
  "prompt_tokens": 15000,
  "completion_tokens": 2200,
  "started_at": "2026-08-03T01:40:00.000Z",
  "duration_seconds": 42.0,
  "cap_hit": false,
  "scripted_replies": 1,
  "cached_prompt_tokens": 9000        // sum of whatever provider cache-hit field (if any) each round's usage carried
}

**Result layout and model tag.** Artifacts land in `tests/bench/results/<prefix>-agentic/<qid>/`
— the `-agentic` suffix keeps agentic runs in their own model tag, never mixed with single-shot
runs of the same provider (`score.mts`'s model-tag directories are the comparison unit; a
`qwen-agentic` row and a `qwen` row are two different runs of two different modes, not
comparable to each other). With `--model=<id>` given, the tag becomes `<id>-agentic` instead of
`<prefix>-agentic` (`deriveModelTag`) — e.g. `pnpm bench:agentic qwen --model=qwen-flash` lands in
`qwen-flash-agentic/`, never mixed into `qwen-agentic/`'s runs of the different model
`qwen3.6-27b` the bare `QWEN` prefix normally asks for. The model does its actual work inside a `workspace/` subdirectory one
level below that (`tests/bench/results/<prefix>-agentic/<qid>/workspace/`) — `score.mts` reads
`<resultsDir>/<model-tag>/<qid>/` directly and has no knowledge of `workspace/`, so after the tool
loop ends the harness itself locates the model's final artifact inside `workspace/` (a
`deck.spec.json` project, preferred, or a single bare IR `*.json`) and copies it up into the
question root as `deck.json` (or the deck-project's own files) before writing `meta.json`. If the
model never called a tool at all and just answered with IR text in its final message (a legitimate
outcome worth recording, not a failure) — the harness saves that text as `answer.json` at the
question root instead, the same convention `run.mts` uses for its single-shot answers.

## Probe bank (`questions-probe/`)

A second, separate question bank — `tests/bench/questions-probe/p01..p08`, its own id namespace, the main `questions/q01..q20` bank untouched — built for exactly one purpose: **evidence-gate input for the candidate component pool** (`.issues/specs/2026-07-24-pptpress-layout-component-roadmap.md` §5/§7), not model benchmarking. The gate requires ≥2 distinct-scenario cases per candidate of "the model wanted to express X and the existing 33-component pool could not carry it" before that candidate gets built. The 2026-07-24 rerun (`.issues/notes/quality-evidence.md`) found the main bank structurally incapable of producing this evidence — it was authored around the existing pool, so no question in it ever puts a model in a position where only a missing component would do. The probe bank exists to put the model in exactly that position, once per candidate.

**Scores from this bank are diagnostic, not comparative.** There is no "probe bank pass rate" worth tracking release over release — the deliverable is the qualitative read of what a model tried to do when the pool couldn't carry its intent, produced by a human (or an agent doing the analysis pass, not the run itself) reading each artifact.

### Candidates and prompts

One question per candidate, chosen from the roadmap's §7 candidate pool:

| id | candidate | scenario |
|---|---|---|
| p01 | hierarchy | a three-level, asymmetric reporting-line announcement (a flat list would lose the who-reports-to-whom grouping) |
| p02 | cycle | a four-stage support routine that explicitly closes the loop and repeats indefinitely |
| p03 | agenda | a six-section meeting deck's opening slide, one section marked as currently active |
| p04 | tier_stack | a four-rung capability-maturity ladder, deliberately without per-rung counts/percentages (kept out of funnel territory) |
| p05 | people_cards | five new executives introduced by name/title/one-line background/current remit, initials in place of photos |
| p06 | withdrawn | a twelve-name, equal-weight customer/partner proof slide for an investor deck |
| p07 | venn | two teams' responsibilities where the overlap itself (three shared duties) is the argument being made |
| p08 | device_mockup | a real attached product screenshot that needs to read as "a phone in someone's hand," not a floating image (materials pattern follows q02/q12) |

### `meta.json` fields

Same schema as the main bank (`coverage.strategy`/`pacing`/`expects_components`/`workflow`/`image_deck`, `lang`), plus two probe-only fields — `meta.json` is never shown to the model-under-test, same as the main bank:

```jsonc
{
  "probe": true,               // marks this question as belonging to the probe bank
  "probe_candidate": "hierarchy" // which §7 candidate component this question targets
}
```

`expects_components` here does **not** name the candidate (the candidate does not exist yet) — it names the existing-pool component(s) a model would most plausibly reach for while hard-fitting the scenario into the current 33, e.g. hierarchy → `architecture`/`flowchart`, venn → `rings`/`comparison`, agenda → `numbered_cards`/`row_cards`. The rationale for each pairing lives here (JSON has no comment syntax to carry it inline):

- **p01 hierarchy** → `architecture` (nearest node-and-connection shape), `flowchart` (branching-process shape, sometimes mis-reached-for even without a decision to branch on)
- **p02 cycle** → `steps` (linear-process shape, no native loop-back), `flowchart` (branching shape, sometimes forced into a loop)
- **p03 agenda** → `numbered_cards`/`row_cards` (list shapes with no way to mark one item as "current" without extra text)
- **p04 tier_stack** → `comparison` (side-by-side shape, not stacked/ordered), `matrix` (2×2 grid, wrong axis count for an n-rung ladder)
- **p05 people_cards** → `row_cards`/`icon_cards` (nearest per-person card shapes, no dedicated person/avatar semantics)
- **p06 withdrawn brand-marks wall** → `image_grid` (nearest equal-weight grid shape, built for photos not marks/wordmarks), `icon_cards`
- **p07 venn** → `rings` (nearest circular-comparison shape, no true set-intersection region), `comparison` (side-by-side, no overlap region at all)
- **p08 device_mockup** → `image` (plain image, no frame semantics), `image_compare` (two-image shape, not a device-frame shape)

### How to run

Single-shot mode against the four weak test-account models (`.env` prefixes `DSPRO`/`DEEPSEEK`/`QWEN35`/`QWEN`, same accounts the main bank rerun used), one probe result tree kept separate from the main bank's:

```bash
for p in DSPRO DEEPSEEK QWEN35 QWEN; do
  pnpm bench:run "$p" --questions-dir=tests/bench/questions-probe --results-dir=tests/bench/results-probe
done
pnpm bench:score tests/bench/questions-probe tests/bench/results-probe
```

`tests/bench/results-probe/` is gitignored (same as `tests/bench/results/`) — nothing under it is ever committed, only the question bank and code that produced it.

### Analysis protocol

The mechanical scores (`validatePass`/`auditFindingCount`/`renderOk`/`coverageHits`) are a starting filter, not the finding. For every produced artifact, read it and classify what actually happened using the same buckets the 2026-07-24 rerun's gap analysis used (`.issues/notes/quality-evidence.md`'s failure-attribution table):

- **EXPRESSION-GAP** — the artifact this bank exists to surface: the model reached for an existing component and visibly bent its semantics to fit content that component's own contract doesn't cover (e.g. a `flowchart` with no real decision branch standing in for a reporting tree, a `comparison` with more than two sides standing in for a ladder), or the model bullets-dumped the structure into plain text/`bullets` because nothing in the pool fit and it gave up trying to structure it, or — the strongest possible signal — the model invented a `type` string that does not exist in the schema at all (an automatic `validatePass: false`, worth reading regardless of the fail).
- **COMPONENT-CHOICE** — the model picked a real, defensible component that is merely a worse fit than one of the `expects_components` guesses, without visibly abusing its semantics — evidence *against* the gate for that scenario, not for it.
- **SCHEMA / CONTENT / OTHER** — same meaning as the main bank's rerun analysis (schema-shape mistakes, content-quality issues, everything else) — noise relative to this bank's purpose, but still worth tallying so an EXPRESSION-GAP claim isn't cherry-picked out of a batch of otherwise-broken artifacts.

A candidate clears the evidence gate's ≥2-distinct-scenario bar only on **EXPRESSION-GAP** findings, and per §5's own wording, distinct scenario means distinct underlying case, not distinct model — the same p0x prompt hard-fit by two different models is one scenario, not two. This analysis pass is deliberately not performed by the run itself (`run.mts`/`score.mts` stay purely mechanical, no subjective dimension, `AGENTS.md`'s "评审基调") — it is the controller's next dispatch after the artifacts exist.
