/**
 * Agentic tool-loop benchmark runner against an external OpenAI-compatible
 * API (BENCH-01, `.issues/2026-08-03-bench-agentic/plan.md`). Unlike
 * `run.mts` (one completion, model must answer with bare IR text), this
 * runner gives the model-under-test real function-calling tools — write a
 * file, read a file, list a directory, run the pptwise CLI — inside a
 * private per-question workspace, and lets it iterate: write IR, run
 * `validate`/`audit`, read the findings, fix, repeat. This is the mode
 * `tests/bench/README.md`'s "Run protocol" describes end to end; `run.mts`
 * is the stricter single-shot floor measurement next to it.
 *
 * Tool surface (deliberately minimal and neutral, plan 裁定 1): no general
 * shell. `run_pptwise` only accepts a whitelisted, read-only/artifact
 * subcommand — no `serve` (interactive), no `plan`/`scenarios` (removed
 * vocabulary-v4 aliases), no `check-update`/`self-update` (network side
 * effects unrelated to the benchmark). Every path argument to any tool —
 * `write_file`/`read_file`/`list_files`'s own `path`, and every non-flag
 * `run_pptwise` argument — is resolved against the workspace and rejected
 * if it is absolute or escapes the workspace via `..`. Symlink-based
 * escapes are out of scope (not checked) — the workspace is a
 * harness-created scratch directory the model itself populates, not
 * attacker-controlled input.
 *
 * No pre-injected vocabulary (schema/narratives/themes JSON) in the system
 * prompt — unlike `run.mts`, whose model has no tools and depends entirely
 * on injection. This runner's model can call `run_pptwise schema` /
 * `narratives --json` / `themes --json` itself, exactly what
 * `tests/bench/README.md`'s run protocol and the SKILL playbook already
 * describe ("give the model SKILL.md + prompt.md, let it run the SKILL's
 * workflow"). Injecting the vocabulary anyway would be a convenience that
 * the protocol never asked for and that `run.mts` already covers as the
 * no-tools floor measurement — dropping it here is more protocol-faithful,
 * not a shortcut, and it is most of this runner's ~83k-token-per-round
 * system prompt cost.
 *
 * Tool-result cap: every tool's return string is capped at
 * `TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS` before it goes back into the conversation — see
 * that constant's own comment for the size and the truncate-from-the-end
 * rationale.
 *
 * Round cap: `ROUND_CAP` chat-completion calls total (plan 裁定 2, raised
 * twice since — see that constant's own doc comment for the history) — one
 * round may contain several tool calls, they all count as one round. Hitting
 * the cap stops the run with `cap_hit: true` in meta.json; whatever the
 * model wrote up to that point is left in place, same as a natural stop.
 *
 * meta.json is harness-written, never model-self-reported (2026-07-20's
 * archived round found model-reported identity untrustworthy) — it records
 * both `model_requested` (the .env `<PREFIX>_MODEL` value we asked for) and
 * `model_reported` (the `model` field the API actually echoed back, per
 * round, deduplicated) side by side without reconciling them.
 *
 * Usage: `pnpm bench:agentic <prefix> [q01 q02 ...]` (default: all
 * questions in questionsDir). Same `.env` credential shape as `run.mts`:
 * `<PREFIX>_BASE_URL` / `<PREFIX>_API_KEY` / `<PREFIX>_MODEL`. `--model=<id>`
 * overrides `<PREFIX>_MODEL` for this run only (same flag, same semantics as
 * `run.mts`'s `--model` — see that file's header for the motivating case);
 * the result model-tag then derives from the override, not the prefix — see
 * `deriveModelTag` below.
